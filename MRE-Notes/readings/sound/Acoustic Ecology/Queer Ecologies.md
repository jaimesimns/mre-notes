### Queer Ecology
Queer ecology recognizes that people often regard nature in terms of dualistic notions like "natural and unnatural", "alive or not alive" or "human or not human", when in reality, nature exists in a continuous state. ==The idea of "natural" arises from human perspectives on nature, not "nature" itself.== Queer ecology rejects ideas of human exceptionalism and anthropocentrism that propose that humans are unique and more important than other non-human nature. Specifically, queer ecology challenges traditional ideas regarding which organisms, species, and individuals have value.
