(referenced as 'colonial folk music' because there is Indigenous folk music which stems from its own long-lasting musical tradition)

For much of its history, Australia's bush music belonged to an oral and folkloric tradition, and was only later published in print in volumes such as [Banjo Paterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo_Paterson "Banjo Paterson")'s _Old Bush Songs_, in the 1890s. The distinctive themes and origins of Australia's "bush music" or "[bush band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_band "Bush band") music" can be traced to the songs sung by the convicts who were sent to Australia during the early period of the British colonisation, beginning in 1788. Early Australian ballads sing of the harsh ways of life of the epoch and of such people and events as [bushrangers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushranger "Bushranger"), [swagmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swagmen "Swagmen"), [drovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drover_(Australian) "Drover (Australian)"), [stockmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockman_(Australia) "Stockman (Australia)") and [shearers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep_shearer "Sheep shearer"). Convict and bushranger verses often railed against government tyranny. Classic bush songs on such themes include: "[The Wild Colonial Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Colonial_Boy "The Wild Colonial Boy")", "[Click Go the Shears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_Go_the_Shears "Click Go the Shears")", "The Drover's Dream", "The Queensland Drover", "The Dying Stockman" and "[Moreton Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreton_Bay_(song) "Moreton Bay (song)")".[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Australia#cite_note-ReferenceA-10)

Later themes which endure to the present include the experiences of war, of droughts and flooding rains, of [Aboriginality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aborigines "Australian Aborigines") and of the railways and trucking routes which link Australia's vast distances. Isolation and loneliness of life in the [Australian bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_bush "Australian bush") have been another theme. "[Waltzing Matilda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltzing_Matilda "Waltzing Matilda")", often regarded as Australia's unofficial [national anthem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem "National anthem"), is a quintessential Australian folk song, influenced by Celtic folk ballads. Country and folk artists such as [Tex Morton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tex_Morton "Tex Morton"), [Slim Dusty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slim_Dusty "Slim Dusty"), [Rolf Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolf_Harris "Rolf Harris"), [The Bushwackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bushwackers_(band) "The Bushwackers (band)"), [John Williamson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williamson_(singer) "John Williamson (singer)"), and [John Schumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Schumann "John Schumann") of the band [Redgum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redgum "Redgum") have continued to record and popularise the old bush ballads of Australia through the 20th and into the 21st century â€“ and contemporary artists including [Sara Storer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Storer "Sara Storer") and [Lee Kernaghan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kernaghan "Lee Kernaghan") draw heavily on this heritage.

Australia has a unique tradition of folk music, with origins in both the indigenous music traditions of the original Australian inhabitants, as well as the introduced folk music (including [sea shanties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_shanties "Sea shanties")) of 18th and 19th century Europe. [Celtic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts "Celts"), [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_people "English people"), [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans "Germans") and [Scandinavian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_folklore "Scandinavian folklore") folk traditions predominated in this first wave of European immigrant music. The Australian tradition is, in this sense, related to the traditions of other countries with similar ethnic, historical and political origins, such as [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand"), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada"), and the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States "United States"). The Australian indigenous tradition brought to this mix of novel elements, including new instruments, some of which are now internationally familiar, such as the [didgeridoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didgeridoo "Didgeridoo") of Northern Australia. A number of British singers have spent periods in Australia and have included Australian material in their repertoires, e.g. [A. L. Lloyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._L._Lloyd "A. L. Lloyd"), Martin Wyndham-Read and [Eric Bogle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Bogle "Eric Bogle").
