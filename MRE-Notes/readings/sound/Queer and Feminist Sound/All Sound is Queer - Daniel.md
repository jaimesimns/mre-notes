ALL SOUND IS QUEER
Drew Daniel  

The celebration of gay and lesbian difference offers no real alternative to a dominant neoliberal capitalist democratic culture that is only too happy to reinforce, include, and cater to them all as a dutiful rainbow coalition of subject-­‐consumers. ==Which is what makes hearing sound, rather than being hailed by music, so powerfully odd, and so potentially “queer.”==

By contrast to vision, ==sound queers identity,== and in the process offers a way  
out of the hailing game. It does so by being an involuntary solvent of the self. As  
everyone knows, you cannot close your ears. Going further than most, Jacques Lacan declares that we cannot even fantasize an alternative: “In the field of the unconscious, the ears are the only orifice that cannot be closed.”3 The promiscuous open-­‐ness of the ear, a hole that takes all comers, means that we as living systems  are open to and invaded by the world. Sound queers the self/world boundary, all day, everyday. In so doing, it blurs the edges of any self that the subject-­‐machine cares to hail; ==even in the midst of the “hey you, here’s your house music” there are other noises afoot, other sounds playing, other ways to become something more or less than one more obedient minority subject.==

Which is why talk about gays and lesbians in music ought to productively  
shift towards the queerness of sound itself, as both an agent and a solvent of the  
political experience of antagonism encountered when hailing fails and the promise  
of gay community peters out. Sound-­‐ not music but sound-­‐ can let us hear what is not  
yet locatable on the available maps of identity. Hearing the queerness of sound  
might help us echolocate the edges of subjection, and encounter the all that stands  
outside the hailing process.  
THE SOUND OF THE WORLD  
All sound is queer. The “all” means: any, and each, and their endless  
summation, the sound of the world. To hear this sound is to become queered.

A queer story, this. For what is this openness to the tune and tone of experience, a  
twist which inspires horror and confusion in the bystanders who represent the  
productive adult world, if not a kind of audio-­‐orientation, a sonosexuality? To hear  
“too much”, to hear what is “too quiet”, to claim to hear what we all know is not  
there to be heard, is to be cut off from the human community. And yet that occurs  
not as a flight from the world, but as a flight into the world, a tunneling into the  
telluric grounding of the ultimate Earth, the subtone of planetary hum. Heard in this  
way, Shiel’s sound of the world seems somehow both entirely everyday and yet  
inhuman, dangerous, seductive, and alien.  
We can hear the unacknowledged “sound of the world” as many things.  
Perhaps it is the grinding daily rhythm of alienated labor in the streets and the  
factories and the casual temporary contracts of the quasi-­‐employed, the ongoing  
hum and hiss of capital that the prevailing “distribution of the sensible”-­‐ to use the  
formulation of Jacques Ranciere-­‐ encourages us to tune out and ignore.5 Now, after  
the bubble and the crash, do we even know what work sounds like?  
If music has served to distract us from work, it has also tried to help us hear  
the sound of work in a new way.
