[Sonic Flux: Sound, Art, and Metaphysics - Cristoph Cox](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo27886631.html)

"From Edison’s invention of the phonograph through contemporary field recording and [[sound]] installation, artists have become attracted to those domains against which music has always defined itself: noise, [[silence]], and environmental sound. Christoph Cox argues that these developments in the sonic arts are not only aesthetically but also philosophically significant, revealing sound to be a continuous material flow to which human expressions contribute but which precedes and exceeds those expressions. Cox shows how, over the course of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, philosophers and sonic artists have explored this “sonic flux.”
