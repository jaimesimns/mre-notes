**Not useful for the history, but the artistry is super interesting. Good photos of along the river as well, mostly from Riverkeeper website.**

"An edge is where a surface finishes and another surface begins. With regards to the river, there is a continuous dynamic line that defines where the water starts and the land ends, although, one should note that these two conditions are constantly interconnected and changing. In other words, the edge condition is a boundary or a border. Looking at the following drawings, I see different edges along the Ottawa River. To me not only the surface matters, but also the section, below and above the water and land line, which means that the edge has a depth and a thickness and is in essence a three-dimensional entity that can and should be experienced. I am interested to explore through phenomenology the architecture of the edge condition and the Ottawa River. The most important factor about the edge is that it cannot be simply defined as ‘one’. There are series of edges, and series of moments and conditions that happen and come to define different dynamic lines."
