- "The Lachine Canal is probably Canadaâ€™s most prominent example of industrial heritage. Interpretative panels situated all along the canal present a birthplace of industry narrative.  Passersby learn about the factories that used to line the canal, what they made, and how many worked there. Industrial architecture is also a topic of conversation. But there is nothing here on unions, strikes, or the residential neighborhoods that still stand nearby, but just beyond view. Industrial vestiges are carefully curated, valued for their sense of pastness. Parks Canada does not control any of the buildings; it only owns the canal and a few meters of land on either side."
  - useful for my MRE re: making sure not the curate the sense of industry too much/should not glorify it 
  - good for discussing why I am choosing to do a piece on the timber trade/timber mills but focusing not on the nation-building aspects, but instead on the negative effects of the trade (both for people and for river environment)
