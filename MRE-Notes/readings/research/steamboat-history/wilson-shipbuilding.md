### Ship Building in 19th Century Canada: An Overview (pg 24)
- 19th century was "golden age" of Canadian shipbuilding; occured in conjunction with "the effective harvesting and export of Canadian timber"
	- also a period of dramatic technological change in shipbuilding techniques, with the rise of mechanically-powered vessels and largest merchant sailing ships yet
- "While shipbuilding developed out of the timber trade, timber exports thrived on preferential duties. By 1809, the closure of ports on the eastern Baltic crucial to British naval supply sparked a crisis that brought about the doubling of duties on continental timber in an effort to encourage colonial production. '32 By 1813, a further 25 percent increase was applied and remained in effect until 1821 . In that year came the first of a series of partial reductions in these duties leading to their elimination in 1851 and final removal in 1860.'33 The impact of the preferential tariffs is evident in the fact that, before 1840, timber from Canada sold in England at thirty shillings to two pounds per load lower than the equivalent Baltic product, though the former generally cost about ten shillings per load more to cut and ship to market. 134 Such was the success of these duties in stimulating the British North American timber industry that "in every year from 1816 to 1846 Canadian timber accounted for at least 60 percent of all British imports of unsawn timber and in most years for over 75 percent."'35 Much of the additional real cost of Canadian timber owed to freight rates, although "reductions corresponded fairly closely both in timing and in amount with the reductions in the duties, presumably a reflection, in part at least, of the anxiety of shipowners to keep their ships employed."'3s Evidence indicates that Baltic producers were willing to pay the additional freight rates to ship their products into England through colonial ports (that is, across the Atlantic and back) in order surreptitiously to avoid these duties." (pg 25; also 'Lower, Great Britain's Woodyard, pp. 54-55'.)

- "In his examination of nineteenth-century shipbuilding in British North America, Richard Rice identified four primary means by which the timber trade promoted the construction of colonial tonnage: 1) the creation of a high volume of trade between Great Britain and its North American colonies; 2) the provision of large quantities of low cost shipbuilding timber; 3) the concentration of export activity in locations also well-suited to shipbuilding, and; 4) the promotion and integration of related businesses .138 Of these four, Rice placed greatest importance on the last, arguing that such related businesses were "the agencies of the economic factors . . . . In form they were certainly not new, but what was unprecedented was their brute number and pervasiveness. Every stage in the trade was characterized by a more or less large number of capitalistic enterprises." 139 Rice's point is well-taken, yet all four factors were closely connected. Indeed, in recognizing the generation of export trade and the provision of abundant shipbuilding material as important components in the relationship between the timber trade and shipbuilding, Rice simply acknowledges the linkages defined in classic staple theory . Fueled by a growing demand for wood in England, the export of timber from British North America expanded from some 98 900 tons in 1808 to over a million tons by 1847.140 To carry this freight, "up to a fifth or more of all British registered tonnage was engaged.""' This increase in trade required the construction of new ships. Return voyages carried a variety of processed or manufactured goods and, most importantly, provided a relatively inexpensive means of transport for the growing numbers of emigrants." (pg 26; also Pomfret, The Economic Development of Canada, p. 25.)
- With the growing ascendency of laissez-faire economic policy in Britain during the first half of the nineteenth century, the timber duties were slowly removed, beginning in earnest around 1840. Although this loss of preference was gradual and offset in the short term by declining freight rates, the long-term impact on shipbuilding in Quebec and the maritimes was aggravated by the repeal of the Navigation Acts in 1849 . (pg 27)
- Steam navigation in Canada began in Montreal in 1809 with the the steamship Accommodation built by the brewing magnate, John Molson . The immediate inspiration for this vessel had come directly from the pioneering efforts of Robert Fulton on the Hudson River in 1807 . However, unlike Fulton's ship, the Clermont, which was powered by an English-built, Boulton & Watt engine, both the hull and the machinery of the Accommodation were manufactured in Canada . 160 Accommodation was, therefore, the first completely North American-built steamship . The vessel was intended for passenger and light freight service between Montreal and Quebec, and although it was less than a complete technological success (its engine was rather weak and its boiler needed replacement after only one season), it served to demonstrate the utility and appeal of steam-powered vessels to British North American entrepeneurs . Economically speaking, what distinguished the building of steamships from the building of sailing vessels was their respective financial requirements. Building wooden sailing vessels demanded relatively little capital outlay and, as Rice has noted, in this line of the business "the shipbuilder had little interest in promoting industrialization ." 161 With steamships, however, the opposite was generally true. In an article which directly addresses the economics of early steamship construction in England, Sarah Palmer notes that: for probably the majority of companies and individuals concerned with the business of steam shipping in its earliest days, the most significant characteristics of such enterprise were the risks attached and the severe financial consequences of failure. Both were a result of the high capital costs involved. (pg 28-29; also Sarah Palmer, "Experience, Experiment and Economics: Factors in the Construction of Early Merchant Steamships," Ships and Shipbuilding in the North Atlantic Region: Proceedings of the Conference of the Atlantic Canada Shipping Project, 1977 (St. John's: Memorial University of Newfoundland, 1977), p. 234.)
- From a technical perspective, steamship building during the first half of the nineteenth century, in Canada as elsewhere, involved two distinct areas of enterprise which contain the roots of the modern distinction between naval architecture and marine engineering. The first concerned the shipwright who provided the hull and superstructure, and the second, the forge operater/engine builder, who produced the machinery. Steamships could be, and were built almost anywhere a slipway could be erected and appropriate materials and labour assembled. Aside from some additional reinforcement of the hull and alterations to the superstructure, early steamships were built using the same techniques and tools as sailing ships. They were often also built to be sailed, if circumstances required. On the other hand, engine construction was a specialized, labour-intensive activity concentrated in only a few urban centres . As a rule, investors would have a hull constructed and order the engine to be built and delivered to the shipyard. With the notable exception of Accommodation, for the first two decades of the nineteenth century, British North American steamships had their hulls built in the colonies but were powered by imported, usually British, engines . Eventually, however, local production developed in response to the growing demand . In British North America the focus of this development was Montreal, starting with the Eagle Foundry in 1819.115 A port city of growing economic influence, Montreal was well situated to serve as a gateway to both the Atlantic and the expanding Canadian interior; the development of steam navigation, in turn, greatly facilitated that role. Other foundries of various sizes were established over the course of the next thirty years, both in Montreal and elsewhere in British North America. Almost invariably, the markets they served were dominated by the demand for marine engines . 166 In short, the early growth of heavy industry in British North America was inextricably related to the demand for steam-powered ships. While it is true that the railways ultimately drained much of the vitality out of the inland steamship business, it is equally true that steamship engine production provided much of the infrastructure and skills required by the various industrial activities associated with Canadian railway construction and westward expansion. (pg 28-29; also McNally provides a thorough review of early Canadian engine foundries in "Montreal Engine Foundries," pp. 24-46 and 105-111 . 167. Ibid., pp. 87-88. As McNally points out, the contribution of the Montreal foundries to the railway industry did not, however, include locomotive construction.)
