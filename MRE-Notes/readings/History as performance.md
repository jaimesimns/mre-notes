"Introduction" David Dean, Yana Meerzon, and Kathryn Prince (2015)

"In 2002, historian Greg Dening encouraged his colleagues to reflect on the processes by which they make sense of the past. He suggested that a good place to start would be for historians to think of themselves as performers. By acknowledging their own performances in the archives and in writing about the past, historians would be alert to ‘the fictions in our non-fiction,’ an awareness that he imagined as liberating (Dening, 2002, p. 1). After all, he wrote, ==‘History – the past transformed into words or paint or play – is always a performance’ (Dening, 2002, p. 1).== If historians needed reminding that history is a performance, Diana Taylor, writing a year later, suggested that theatre scholars had misread the relationship between performance and reality: she called on them to recognize and problematize the ways in which performance not only depicts, but also actualizes, the real."

As academics working at the intersection of history and performance, we have found our own scholarly practices transformed through our exposure to the different ways in which our contributors, and the artists and academics cited in their work, negotiate the distance between past and present. For us, and for our contributors, ==memory acts as a shared crucible of discovery and a distorting lens through which history and theatre engage with the past.==

In considering their own and each other’s disciplines, the theatre scholars and public historians who have contributed to this collection of essays draw upon ==the archives and repertoires of memory, a notion understood on the one hand in its collective, national, and public contexts and on the other as something acutely personal, subjective, individual, even idiosyncratic and unreliable.== Recent developments in the practice and theory of autobiography, testimony, documentary, and verbatim theatre suggest that the concept of memory inspires artistic as well as academic engagement as is reflected in this volume through analyses of theatre, re-enactment, dance, and visual art that explore the interconnectedness of history and memory in performance. These developments resonate with the work of historians who have taken to heart Joseph Roach’s assertion that ==‘the pursuit of performance does not require historians to abandon the archive, but it does encourage them to spend more time in the streets’ (Roach, 1996, p. xii).==

When history and performance intersect, Freddie Rokem suggests, actors can connect the historical past with its performance in a later present: they become a kind of historian, what I call a ‘hyper-historian’, who makes it possible for us – even in cases where the reenacted events are not fully acceptable for the academic historian as a ‘scientific’ representation of that past – to recognize that the actor is ‘redoing’ or ‘reappearing’ as something/somebody that has actually existed in the past. (Rokem, 2000, p. 13)

==****this focuses only on theatre, but I propose that soundwork/sound art should be included too.==

‘the real insofar as it is entangled within the scientific operations (the present society, to which the historians’ problematics, their procedures, modes of comprehension, and finally a practice of meaning are referable)’ (de Certeau, 1988, p. 35). [This]implies a narrative shaped in some way by present purposes (de Certeau, 1988, pp. 35–6); ... de Certeau insisted, ==in narrativizing the past historians do not obliterate the real, they simply displace it. Consequently, ‘history endlessly finds the present in its object and the past in its practice’ (de Certeau, 1988, p. 43).==

Public history, the study of how people consume and shape history, is an important part of the conversation between history, memory, and performance, and it is a site of debate over the ownership and implications of these terms (de Groot, 2009; Ashton and Kean, 2009). Public history practitioners attempt to create affective encounters for the public in museums, galleries, heritage houses, historic sites, memorials, and commemorative spaces, disseminating knowledge on blogs and Twitter as well as in more traditional academic venues. These affective representations of the past are often scrutinized and sometimes resisted by academic historians, although they too have devoted considerable attention to equally affective forms of public engagement with the past such as family history, photographs, film, historical fiction novels, and social media (Agnew, 2007; McCalman and Pickering, 2010).

While theatre remains under-represented in public history scholarship, sites such as museums, living history performances, film, and television have provided rich sources of intersection and debate, stimulating discussions about shared and sharing authority between producers and consumers of history (Rosenzweig and Thelen, 2000; Ashton and Hamilton, 2010; The Pasts Collective, 2013; Dean, 2012; Frisch, 1990; High, 2009). For public historians, the presence of the ‘real’ in historical performance must be constantly negotiated. Costumed living history interpreters and guides, participants in reconstructions of military engagements, and of course actors (professional or amateur) participating in filmed, televised, or digitalized historical performances are also Rokem’s hyper-historians. Their embodiments of the past, their adoption of first-, second-, or third-person voices, of gestures, movements, and emotions, and, just as importantly, the spaces in which they perform, ==shape the real that is presented to the public and that is energized by the public’s engagement with the re-presented past. ==The public, as public historians are keen to point out, is not a passive consumer, but shapes the meaning of the past and contributes to its performance no less than how the audiences of a theatrical performance and the spaces in which theatre takes place help shape history-making on stage.

==The historical distance between the past and its later representation is a matter of negotiation that is complex because the present’s knowledge of the past is necessarily fragmentary, and because archives, memories, and performances are always ‘haunted,’ as Marvin Carlson (2001) has suggested, by both the creators of repositories in the past (such as archivists, playwrights, historiographers) and by the knowledge possessed by individual consumers in the present (including readers, visitors, spectators).== We would expand this helpful insight to all forms of representation (text, image, sound, performance) and to all places and spaces (theatre, film, art, archives, museums, historic sites, streets, landscapes, and so on).

==When we contemplate how historical meaning is created through performance, the notion of ‘embodying the past’ becomes central; by embodiment we refer especially to the ways in which bodies moving through space and time both enact and re-enact the past, thus closing the distance between the past that is represented and the present in which it is performed. It is through repetition that we actualize the real past.==

By referencing the iterability of performance we recall the arguments of linguist Jacques Derrida (1988) and philosopher Judith Butler (1993, 1999), among others, who emphasize that ==it is through a process of repetition that we not only remember and reconstruct, but that in so doing, we recognize the artificiality of memorial and historical performances.== Such constructions of the past, founded however much on the ‘real,’ are dependent to a degree on imagination. As Natalie Zemon Davis (2003, p. 47), a historian who has explored the past performatively in text, film, and stage, advises: ‘Let the imagination be guided by evidence, interpreted as best one can, when it is available and, when it is not available, by the spirit or general direction of the evidence.’ ==If we can agree that the ‘real’ is always present in our performances of the past, perhaps we can also agree that our performances give back to the past its own present.== The same is true of actors on stage or performers at historic sites, for ==in re-writing, re-staging, and re-enacting (re-constructing, re-constituting, re-presenting, re-imagining, or, as de Certeau would have it, resuscitating) the past, we are not simply making the past visible in the present, we are making the past in the present.== As Dening (2002, p. 4) puts it, when historians perform in the archives they read ‘to write true stories, history,’ and they write ‘I write’ ‘to give back to the past its own present moments.’ Rokem (2000, p. 194) takes this one step further in stating: ‘the issue that has been raised here is in what sense a historical event continues to be present and to reverberate in contemporary plays and performances about this event.

==Giving the past back its own present is one of the singular achievements of performed history and it can produce new ways of understanding that past.== (pg 7)

More contentious is the suggestion that through performance historical consciousness and historical understanding are shaped and nurtured.  

If reading against the grain is one way of remembering history differently, ==connecting with the past through performance can serve a similar purpose, insisting on the present value of remembering, at times even the value of remembering what a culture or an individual has laboured to forget.== As Katherine Hodgkin and Susannah Radstone (2006) and their contributors suggest in Memory, History, Nation: Contested Pasts, ==memory negotiates the distance between history as the ‘real’ past and history writing in the present, enabling us to know, or to think we know, about a past that we ourselves have not experienced. Yet memory is also very much about the present, its truth-telling is changeable, variable, and contestable (Hodgkin and Radstone, 2006). Seemingly fixed national narratives and cultural certainties are disrupted when traditions are shown to be inventions, communities share constructed identities, different understandings of the past compete for attention, and silenced or marginalised histories and memories seek visibility== (Anderson, 2006; Boym, 2001 Edkins, 2003; Hobsbawm and Ranger, 1983; Portelli, 1991; Trouillot, 1997).

Collective memory has been a significant theoretical framework for many of the essays in this collection. Drawing on the foundational work of Maurice Halbwachs (1992 [1950]) and Paul Connerton (1989), Jan Assman (1995) has introduced a distinction between communicative memory (shared by and communicated within a social group over a few generations) and cultural memory (shared by a community and often institutionalized). Pierre Nora’s (1996–8, 1999) exploration of the ‘realms of memory’ has encouraged considerations of the ways in which social memory, popular memory, and memory performances operate on local and national levels. The theoretical work of Paul Ricoeur (2000) epitomizes the growing scholarly interest in collective memories of trauma, and can be said to have engendered the emergence of memory studies focusing on the processes of remembering and forgetting, amnesia and nostalgia, on witnessing, and on empathy. The intersection of memory and trauma studies with performance has introduced further nuances to our understanding of individual and collective remembering, and to the impulses behind memorialization and commemoration, as well as to literary, dramatic, filmic, visual, and digital media as realms and sites of memory, particularly in the work of Marianne Hirsch (1997, 1998, 2012).

==Today, scholars are more apt to read the archive suspiciously, aware that any material which is part of the archive is itself already tainted by the circumstances of its recording, the medium it is recorded in, the persons involved in its collection, and its diffusion; the archive is far from being an unmediated repository of fact awaiting the playwright’s imagination.==

In part because Western societies tend to value written and material documentation over performative representations of the past, ==Diana Taylor (2003, p. 19) argues that the repertoire, a counterpoint to the archive, is the embodied performance of memory, providing opportunities for the construction of counter-narratives and the creation of acts of resistance. Often ephemeral, and frequently unregulated, the repertoire has the capacity to challenge, even if it sometimes works with or alongside, the archive, which is likewise a mediated repository of history and memory: ==
		The process of selection, memorization, or internalization, and transmission takes its place within (and in turn helps constitute) specific systems of re-presentation. Multiple forms of embodied acts are always present, though in a constant state of againness. They reconstitute themselves, transmitting communal memories, histories, and values from one group/generation to the next. Embodied and performed acts generate, record, and transmit knowledge. (Taylor, 2003, pp. 20–1)

Since memory is a vital link between our biographical selves and the world beyond our bodies, it becomes a tool to re-insert forgotten time into present narrative, an idea that seems to flow through most of the contributions to this volume. Memory – as personal, collective, imagined, generational, and historical experience – is the most actively interrogated issue that theatre of testimony and witness explores. As a container of collective and personal memories and a vehicle to convey one’s history, the body is a dynamic archive that changes within the space of theatrical communication and that theatre practitioners continuously explore through performers’ physical and oral expressions. At the same time, impossible to record or restore, this archive remains local, specific to each particular cultural, social, historical, interpersonal, and linguistic exchange.
