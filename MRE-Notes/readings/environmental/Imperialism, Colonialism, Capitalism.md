"The emergence of European capitalism was anticipated by the conjunction of racial differentiation and nationalism; the calculus of the world as resource was already in formation centuries before its naming.[6] What was considered not-Man (that which was classified as non-sentient, not self-determined, unknowing, fungible) was valuable only insofar as its accumulation of economic value, always in oppositional and inferior relation.[7] The displacement and genocide of Black and Indigenous people were thus inextricable from conceptualisations of nature as distinct from European religious, social, and political life.[8]
- “Whiteness”, wrote WEB. Du Bois, “is the ownership of the Earth forever and ever, Amen”.[9] The making of nature is tied to the church, the nation-state, and white supremacy, a confluence reiterated again and again through the production of the world. The systemic enslavement of African people by European colonisers, the indenture of South Asian people, the blackbirding of South Sea Islanders violently instrumentalised non-white people for the propagation of white wealth. Vast ecosystems flattened for plantations and fields, raw minerals pulled from the ground and sea for the building of nation-states, agriculture and war.[10] Goenpul scholar Aileen Moreton-Robinson calls the logics of the “white possessive” the mode of rationalisation underpinned by the “desire to invest in reproducing and reaffirming the nation-state’s ownership, control and domination”.[11] White possessiveness underpins capitalism as a structure of ordering relations. The ordering of land into resource also translates into the enclosure of land for pleasure, play and study.[12] What is desirable and worthy of conservation as delineated from what is exploitable for mining, housing, or agriculture has been arbitrated by those who profit, for whom this world is for."
