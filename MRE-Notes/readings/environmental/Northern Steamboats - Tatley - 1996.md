**Introduction (pg. 9)
- Steamboats played an important role in early settler-colonial life
- Lumber trade: towed logs and delivered "provisions to the camps in scows"
- Settlers: helped "them reach their lands with their goods and chattels, and by taking hay and produce to the markets"; also "added a little colour and relaxation to the hard, rough life of [early settlers] by running excursion cruises"
- Railwaymen: assisted by "bringing timber, rails, and supplies - and were often rewarded by being put out of business"
- Prospectors: took the men and "their gear out to the bush during mining booms, and sometimes brought treasure back on their decks"
- Paper mills: towed "in millions of pulpwood logs"

**Ch. 1: Steamboating on Lake Nipissing: 1881-1961 ==NOT OTTAWA RIVER==
- "some spruce and hemlock were shipped out by rail, but lumbermen concentrated on pine; hardwoods tended to sink before they made it to the mill" (21)
-  Most lumber companies "never used tugs, because they could rely on the Booth Company to tow for them" (21)
-  An exception was the  John B. Smith Company, which had the *Sparrow*, a tug used on Lake Nipissing, which "could tow two boom pockets containing up to 48,000 logs at a time - about twice as many as most other tugs." (23)
		-  once picked up 60,000 logs near Frank's Bay; also towed scows that contained groceries like "potatoes, turnips and barrels of flour, lard, butter and salt pork for the lumbering camps and depots, along with tools, hardware, machinery, tobacco, and building supplies. There might also be horses, hay and sleighs needed for winter work in the bush. Occassionally, even a small logging locomotive might be loaded onto a scow to be towed by the *Sparrow*." Also took up to 40 passengers, usually people heading for Frank's Bay; occassionally ran excursion cruises on Sundays or holidays (23)
- Another exception was *John Fraser*, ocassionally misnomered as the John B. Fraser, owned by John Fraser of Powassan
	- towed lumber and squared timber across the lake to North Bay and to provision the camps  (23)


**Chapter 2: Steamboats and Lumbering
- "lumbering follow[ed] the natural waterways" which allowed logs to be floated out and supplies to be freighted in (55)
- pg 55 has the lumber market history if needed
- tugs also used to transport workmen (lumber jacks, sawmill crews/operators, etc.) along the river


**Chapter 3: Steamboats and Settlement
- had info about order of settlement in the upper reaches (lumbermen first and foremost; farmers came later)
- subject to a focus by the Oblates about bringing Christianity
- ie: in 1884, "La Société de la Colonisation de Lac Temiskaming" was estabished in Ottawa on Dec. 12
- the first six settlers under that colonisation scheme were brought by steamer (the *Mattawan*). 


**Chapter 4: Steamboats and Mining**
- started up north 1903ish (discovery of cobalt)
- boom hit its peak around 1914 (pg 105)
- mostly in regards to railways, but ==steamers "did play a modest role in the Cobalt boom, bringing prospectors and supplies, notably tools, machinery, and hydro poles from South Témiscaming and farm produce from Ville Marie, and taking out the occassional cargo of ore." (105)
