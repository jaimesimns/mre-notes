the settler sea: california's salton sea and the consequences of colonialism - traci brynne voyles

Traci Brynne Voyles's history of the Salton Sea examines how settler colonialism restructures physical environments in ways that further Indigenous dispossession, racial capitalism, and degradation of the natural world. In other words, _The Settler Sea_ asks how settler colonialism entraps nature to do settlers' work for them.

"In this story of the Salton Sea, Voyles paints an unconventional picture of a landscape that has been subject to every kind of abuse the settler state can inflict. It is a cautionary tale that links colonization of people with colonization of nature, refusing to see the two as different. And it reminds us that when we think spatially, centering land in our social narratives, we can more clearly see the inequities imposed by the settler state on racialized others. _The Settler Sea_ is a delight to read, mixing metaphor with fact in a way that reflects the contradictions and ambiguities of the Salton Sea."-Dina Gilio-Whitaker, author of _As Long as Grass Grows: The Indigenous Fight for Environmental Justice from Colonization to Standing Rock_

"Traci Brynne Voyles masterfully centers settler colonialism in environmental history, particularly the ways that landscapes and built environments, such as the Salton Sea and its related components, are refigured through settler colonialism to produce settler colonial outcomes. Voyles adeptly draws on many analytical angles to reveal the complexity of the Salton Sea, its complicated ecologies, and its problems."-Joshua L. Reid, author of _The Sea Is My Country: The Maritime World of the Makahs_
