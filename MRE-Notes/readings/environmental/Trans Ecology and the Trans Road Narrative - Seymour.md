- "The first connotation of trans that I take up in this article is that of spatial movement; as I outline here, the crossing of geographical (and not just gender) borders looms large in transgender representation and discourse. But trans is also moving in the psychosomatic and emotional sense, as scholars such as Lucas Crawford and Eva Hayward have recently insisted; thus, the second connotation I take up is trans as affect."
- both the geographical movement of (people) and their ability to be moved: to undergo spiritual or emotional awakenings and to be awed, along with viewers or readers, by striking natural landscapes.
- For Mel Y. Chen, for example, “trans- is not a linear space of mediation between two monolithic, autonomous poles, as, for example, ‘female’ and ‘male’ are…. Rather, it is conceived of as more emergent than determinate, intervening with other categories in a richly elaborated space” (2012, 137).14 
- Don Romesburg declares that “appreciating how ‘trans moves us’ in both spatial and affective ways opens up transgender embodiment as a series of multidirectional, productive, and creative practices” (2012, 120, quoting Crawford 2008; emphasis added), while A. Finn Enke muses about the prefixial property of “trans” and its generative promise: “With its mobilities, it modifies; it is a motion anticipating a second; it enacts, it continues with a question” (2012, 8; emphasis added). I consider Transamerica’s and Nevada’s respective engagements with movement in the following two subsections, charting, more specifically, whether such movement appears as linear or divergent, unidirectional or multidirectional.
