# William Commanda

"Grandfather William Commanda, an Algonquin elder who passed away in 2011, I learned that he advanced the concept of the Circle of All Nations as a vision of peace among all peoples and asked the architect Douglas Cardinal to prepare architectural designs by removing the dam and hydro facilities for an Aboriginal historical centre, a peace centre and a conference facility at the Falls area.6 This project’s intentions was an inspiration for this thesis as it reflects welcoming all to gather for the purpose of reconciliation and celebration of unity" (from [[aghashah-2018]])

Commanda’s vision for the islands is known as Asinabka.8 William Commanda’s Vision for Asinabka shows a series of four visionary programs associated with these islands and the waters. (Fig 3.0) The four programs include: 1. Freeing the Chaudière Falls; 2. Creating a City Park and Historic Interpretive Centre; 3. Building a Peace Building Meeting Site; 4. Building an Aboriginal Centre

Dr. Donaldson’s paper provides a useful elaboration on this information: “The source of the Ottawa River lies within the Quebec portion of the Superior Structural Province of the Canadian Shield, one of two large blocks of Archean igneous and metamorphic rocks that contain the oldest rocks in North America. More that 2.5 billion years old these rocks consist of: (1) Gneiss and large intrusions of granite and other igneous rocks; (2) “Green stone belts” that preserve volcanic edifices in which sea-floor eruptions are widely recorded by pillow structures. The greenstone belts also contain thick accumulations of wackes and similar clastic sedimentary rocks. The wackes commonly display graded bedding indicative of downslope resedimentation of unconsolidated sediment in response to earthquakegenerated underwater landslides (turbidity currents). In addition, some tracts of Archean sedimentary rocks within the Ottawa Valley display large-scale cross-bedding suggestive of terrestrial deposition, as well as both textural and chemical maturity (well-rounded grains: high concentration of queatz sand) suggestive of multicycle origin; and (3) Minor but economically significant deposits of banded iron-formation (chemically precipitated laminated rocks rich in silica and iron oxides, the prime source of iron ore. Next of particular interest is the Gowganda Strata Formation bordering Lake Temiskaming, part of an episode of continental glaciation (2.2 billion years ago) from before the last Ice Age, its geological history revealed by the Nipissing Diabase igneous rock; this was known to the Algonquins in its topographical presentation on the west shore of Lake Temiscaming as Spirit Rock. Then there is the Grenville formation, comprised of metamorphic and intrusive rock, presented most graphically in Oiseau Rock, acknowledge as a site revered by the Algonquins, and also marked by sacred paintings, at the metamorphosed limestone (marble) rocks around Allumette, Calumet and Rocher Fendu, a place of historical significance acknowledged in the 1613

"When Philomen Wright arrived in this area in 1801/2, William Commanda’s direct ancestors from the Quebec/Commandant Lac area were alarmed – their sugar bushes were being cut down and they challenged this (as documented by P. Wright’s daughter, based on his papers). Wright produced a paper, an agreement signed by their ancestors, he said, giving him the right to do this (Royal Proclamation of 1763). They were horrified by this Loup Gareau, this monstrous thing. After the devastating two centuries of European attack on their lands, waters, trees, beavers, language, spiritual practices, lives, health and relationships, they were a decimated peoples, now facing a new threat at the sacred heart of their territory. Wright’s own daughter writes that the Algonquins responded with prayer, sacrifice and tobacco ceremony, to appease and transform the acquisitive and destructive energy they saw in the felling of the precious maple medicine trees."

"Commanda held the Sacred Seven Fire Prophecy Wampum Belt// _The Mishomis Book_)." an [Anishinaabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anishinaabe "Anishinaabe") prophecy that marks phases, or epochs, in the life of the people on [Turtle Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_Island_(North_America) "Turtle Island (North America)")

"Sacred importance: sacred meeting place from time immemorial With the retreat of the Champlain Sea, from 12,000 years ago, there is evidence of the Paleo Indians/ancient maritime navigators, visiting emerging islands and bedrock of the South March Highlands and Gatineau Hills. When the integrity of the landscape is examined, then one notes several critically important things about this area; it lies within vicinity of Ouiseau Rocks pictographs; the vicinity of red ochre mine, Calumet and Allumette (Pipe and Fire/Matchstick Islands pipes and other archaeological items provide evidence of Indigenous presence and ceremony; archeological finds of turquoise from Mexico, copper from Lake Superior and ramah chert from the Labrador are indicative of the nomadic reach of the ancient travellers of 5 to 6 thousand years ago; archaeological finds indicate that it is a site of fisheries/meeting place; it is place for ceremonial acknowledgement and tobacco ceremony; • canoe routes followed river highways; portage routes indicate land passage: here, in Ottawa at Dow’s Falls, the over-land route runs along present-day Preston Street to the Lebreton Flats and the Sacred Chaudière Falls, confirming how important this meeting place was; across, there is the Lac des Fees, the French name indicative of the Indigenous reference to the Little People, and sacred associations; French missionary Sagard noted the fires of ceremonial sweat lodges dotting the landscape; in 1600s, Samuel de Champlain provides description of the Indigenous ceremonial rituals that inspired future artists; in 1803 Algonquins of Lac Commandant area (William Commanda’s people) object to Philomen Wright’s cutting of their sugar bushes, and conduct conciliatory ceremony at the Chaudière site; in the 1800s, newcomers flood the Ottawa River areas; the 1830s rape and impalement/murder of an Algonquin girl by workers at Parliament Hill signals the reasons for the growing absence of Algonquin visibility at the Sacred Site; but Indigenous presence at the site was not extinguished, despite industrial development and contamination at Victoria and Chaudière Islands, and island reconfiguration, bridge building, establishment of logging and pulp and paper mills, hydro dams, newcomer presence, and diseases like cholera. In the seventies, the people gathered there again, creating an Indian Embassy and encampments of resistance to federal programs and policies; the nineties saw the active return of Indigenous Peoples and ceremonies to Victoria Island; many Elders, including late Algonquin Elder Frank Decontie, Late Grandmothers Lillian Pitawanakwat, Irene Lindsay, Jeorgina Laroque and others led sweat lodges and other healing ceremonies here; William Commanda himself cooked and fed the homeless and lost, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous; he also hosted annual Solstice and Equinox Pipe Ceremonies here from the late nineties till his death in 2011; in collaboration with Elders Without Borders, he hosted the 13 Moons Gathering of Indigenous Elders from around the world here; in collaboration with Plenty Canada, he organized Sustainable Relationship workshops, transforming language in environmental discussion. With the prayer that accompanied the release of the report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, he drew attention to the polluted Ottawa River; (he asked the leadership there whether they would be prepared to drink the water – for him, the salvation of the Indigenous Peoples and the salvation of the waters was one and"
