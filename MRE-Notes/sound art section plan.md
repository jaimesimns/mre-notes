The use of sound art in public history: why it is valid and useful


theory behind sound art + [[History as performance]]
theory supporting its use
its history (sound art in art, sound art in ecology, sound art in history) + real life examples of its use
where you can go with it
related disciplines; sound art as a way to diversify who you're reading/citing/drawing upon when doing traditional history
sound as rethinking: the usefulness of soundscapes, sonification, soundwalks, (and other things! point to people to look into; ie: audio walks - cite Danielle, podcasts - cite somebody else, sound in video games - Regan, autoethnographic social activism - cite Meranda, walking tours - cite Ona;  cite as many people in the cohort as possible)
kin-study? (draw on Todd and Kanngeiser) and use the soundwalk as an example
