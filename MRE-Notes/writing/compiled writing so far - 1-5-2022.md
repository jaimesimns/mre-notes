# Walking/Rough intro

Ottawa is full of historical plaques, sculptures, reading panels, etc., which can be summed up as 'heritagisation' (following Svensson, 2021), especially as you get closer to Parliament and the Ottawa River.[[1]](#_ftn1) Much of this ‘heritigization’ is visibly prominent, and in view of pedestrians who are encouraged to engage with the official histories through paved walking paths, no-car streets, or other pedestrian-friendly methods. These are all carefully cultivated, and often tend to have purposeful attempts at creating a sense of ‘nature’.[[2]](#_ftn2) The paths are part of the city's urban policies, and serve as a method of promoting specific aspects of heritage as they intersect with tourism demands.[[3]](#_ftn3)

Ottawa's sense of place as 'the capital of Canada' is reflected both in the ever-increasing number of plaques, historical monuments, panels, etc. as well as in their content. Most focus on important moments in [white, colonial] Canadian history, prioritizing sanitized narratives of upper-class white settlers, politicians, business owners, etc. [find diversity stats on Ottawa's heritage content?]. Many also deal with country-wide history – to commemorate fallen soldiers, victims of genocide, important federal events, or important (usually political) figures.

The narrative presented by the presented heritage is a very sanitized one that only shows Ottawa’s history as the nation’s capital. Besides the fact that it ignores the presence of Algonquin people on this land since time immemorial, it also ignores early Ottawa/Bytown’s rougher origins and role in colonial settlement, the timber trade, the steamboat industry, its copious sawmills, etc. The official narrative strives to hide this working-class history, as well as [the political, social, and environmental issues] during this time. [[add more details about that history, plus the time period I’m focusing on]]

[somebody said that you can’t fix your mistakes without knowing or admitting your past], and that holds true for Ottawa too. It’s impossible to fix past mistakes or acknowledge wrong-doing when you hide the history, and so it’s important to bring that history to the public eye.

This project argues that exploring geolocated soundscapes via walking is an affective piece of public history [affective public history?], and that attending to the affective and emotional aspect of sound and place is an effective pedagogical experience for exploring the political nature of change and its representation of a place’s heritage. [[This will be shown through… my project, which involves a soundwalk located along the Ottawa River between [[x]] and [[y]]. The soundwalk includes…]]

"They, like my neighbour, view the official heritage discourse as quite distant from their own lives and memories" [[Svensson, 2021]]

- perhaps that's why there's so much interest in 'local' or unofficial histories in the area: Ottawa posits itself as the nation's capital, and only celebrates and shares the histories that fit that and that fit the importance that the city feels.

- All of the 'old Ottawa' or 'old ---' Facebook sites, webpages, etc. show that people are interested in reminiscing and sharing their past, but that they don't see their pasts represented within the official narrative

 - **important to recognize that the history that people want to share is white, colonial history, and that its place as buried under the official narrative while still being an incredibly priviledged history speaks to how buried and unappreciated less priviledged histories are - especially in regards to Indigenous and racialized histories within the region (or BIPOC?)

 - side note about London Oxford and his family, and the lack of research about him (also the lack of sources), and his exclusion from the main painting commemorating Philemon Wright

- also good to mention the sanitisation of the history re that period that is mentioned - the focus on the white, rich men running the city and ignoring the working class, new immigrants, women, Indigenous people, racialized people, etc. in those narratives; in addition ignoring the environmental history and the destruction that was caused

# Why walking

Walking can be "an act of resistance, defiance and critique of official urban politics and heritage work" and is a major way that people "engage with and experience heritage.”[[4]](#_ftn4) Walking draws attention to place, and the performative and transformative nature of heritagization. Ottawa is full of constructed heritage - not solely as in heritage buildings, but as in a heritage narrative that has been carefully constructed and construed. The official narrative is sanitized, shiny, and neat; easily sold for tourism and to encourage government officials and public servants to continue to enjoy the city. Even the city's motto, "Canada in one city," reflects this preference for remembering Ottawa's history as a federal center (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/city-ottawa-new-slogan-canada-in-one-city-1.5176001; https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/canada-in-one-city-a-new-slogan-for-our-million-strong-capital).

"City developments and heritigization do not only change modes of walking but may also stimulate more conscious forms of walking, including what has been referred to as conceptual walking, that engages with and/or challenges these developments" (svensson).

- this walk is meant to present various aspects of early Ottawa-and-area history that challenge the official narrative and present some of the less 'shiny' aspects of the past (aka Ottawa as a working class city)

- What does this mean for a city like Ottawa, where the heritage is hidden? What happens when we bring forward the hidden past, and ask people to reengage with it?

"Who engages in walking and when and where can be differentiated by age, gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status, and walking is thus a negotiated and often contested practice that reveals power relations and inequalities in society. In Walter Benjamin’s work the _flâneur_ exemplified both the emergence of a new way of walking among certain individuals as well as changes in the city itself" (Benjamin 2002)

- connect this with changes in Ottawa, with LeBreton Flats, Mechanicsville and Meranda's project, etc.

==City developments and changes such as gentrification, tourism and heritagisation, inevitably have different implications for different groups of people and their walking practices, and walking as a research method can serve as a window to understand these changes. Walking can in these contexts also become an act of resistance, defiance and critique of official urban politics and heritage work (e.g. Solnit [2001](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.library.carleton.ca/doi/full/10.1080/13527258.2020.1821240#); Wang and Kao [2017](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.library.carleton.ca/doi/full/10.1080/13527258.2020.1821240#)). Walking, in other words, can be a method to both discover and transform the city, and also a method to challenge urban developments and policies.==

**this works well with Ottawa, a city filled with "official urban politics and heritage work". Ottawa plays up the nice, clean heritage aspects and focuses on its role as the capital of Canada, but ignores its start as a rough working town that played a large part in the timber trade, steamboat industry, wrecking the Ottawa, the shanty towns, etc. Very little official monuments, plaques, etc. on buildings or areas that admit to that history or its realities

# Soundwalking

Walking offers the opportunity for embodied knowledge; connecting that opportunity with sound allows for that embodied knowledge to merge with a sense of space and a connection to place. As per Westerkamp (1996), soundwalks serve as an embodied method of connecting with sound while moving through space/place; argues that the recording, manipulation, and broadcast of soundwalks can bring listeners closer to the environment - to "awaken curiosity and create a desire for deeper knowledge and info about our own and other places and culture; soundscapes create a clearer sense of place and beloning for composer and listener through artistic transmissions of meanings about place, time, environment, and listening.”[[5]](#_ftn5)

"Our engagement with the world is always interdependent and situated within environments and place. Listening is a way into feeling these relations. Because listening is so ubiquitous, its complexity and expansiveness are often diminished."[[6]](#_ftn6)

"Narrowly (mis)construed as conditional on the ears and the voice, listening is understood as instrumental to sharing language. Listening is, as all communication, trained. It is encultured and geographically specific, shaped by social, political and economic forces, violence and oppression. Despite this, it is expected that we listen in universal ways." [b]

"With these posts I want to emphasise why questions such as “from where do I listen? How do I listen? To what do I attend? What do I hear?” are necessary to thinking about environments and ecosystems. These questions show us that we are always working across difference, which is itself always in-becoming and unknown. The simplicity of such questions belies a profound and critical recognition and responsibility essential to any movement toward abolishing a world built on white supremacist violence and dispossession. The kind of listening that I am attempting to theorise alongside and play with here is unequivocally arduous, slow and constitutes many lifetimes work and thought undertaken by many people across many places. It seeks to undo how we know, live, relate and comport ourselves. It seeks to undo abstractions of harm, capitalist extraction, domination and complicity. It places us in definitive relation with how, where and what we inhabit and need to claim. What is at stake, then, in this listening is the dismantling of what we think we know toward an imagination of becoming otherwise." [b]

# Sound theory

- a soundwalk[[7]](#_ftn7), except, more of an audiowalk[[8]](#_ftn8) due to focus on created over natural sound

- features a map[[9]](#_ftn9) and a constantly running nature track to show that sound/nature is present with or without mediation/human presence.[[10]](#_ftn10) Also ties into feminist sound theory/feminist cinematic theory[[11]](#_ftn11) with considerations of gendered sound (linear vs looping)[[12]](#_ftn12) as well as the gender disparity of soundwalks versus other sonic entanglements.[[13]](#_ftn13)

- Part A: *data sonifications* that run on top of the base track, triggered based on relation to where the person starts/the direction they face.[[14]](#_ftn14)

- geosonifications[[15]](#_ftn15) of previously chosen archival data, but the sonifications feature auditory icons focused on industrial noise[[16]](#_ftn16) and follow noise music theory[[17]](#_ftn17),[[18]](#_ftn18), [[19]](#_ftn19)

- Polli states that soundwalks are in protest of constant industrial noise assaulting sonic environments, except I would like to do the reverse and take the base track of a natural sonic environment and reintroduce industrial noise as the sounds of data (ie: log footage from LAC)[[20]](#_ftn20), [[21]](#_ftn21)

- this has political implications[[22]](#_ftn22) and allows for a connection with acoustic ecology[[23]](#_ftn23) through the conjunction of the base track with the sonifications and the interplay of real and constructed environment through the noise backdrop and geosonifications.

- the choice to focus on auditory nature of an environment "defines historic and ongoing social relations of humans to that environment"[[24]](#_ftn24)

- my choice to focus noise versus music is deliberate and plays with traditional meanings of music vs noise-based soundscape[[25]](#_ftn25); can connect this to Ottawa Valley music traditions arriving from colonial settlement// connect with the colonial nature of settler music in the Ottawa Valley through the traditional meanings of music vs soundscape [see 14 again]; "amplification of the meaning"[[26]](#_ftn26) (26 again - sonifications have been used with embodiment/interactive art installations)

- the use of Ottawa Valley-style music creates engagement at the auditory level with the history itself, not just with the image alone; returning sound to the visual image for a multisensory understanding of the past [16.1, 16.2][[27]](#_ftn27)

- the role of silence/base audio in between reaching different sonifications[[28]](#_ftn28)

# Auditory icons

I am thinking of using auditory icons in the sonification of the datasets (like https://egyptbuildingcollapses.org/) to use the semi-representative sound to evoke emotion (ie: bird noises disappearing over time to represent quantities of trees cut); my goal is to take the data sonification and move it from noise to {semi-pleasant} sound to talk about the affective quality/create an affective quality (also with art of the landscape similar to soundmarks; I really liked the interplay there). Also thinking of site-specific recordings (depending on car access, etc.) to work into the soundscape too to flesh it out.

# Sonification and subjectivity of data

plays with the idea of the 'subjectivity'/'objectivity' of data - data is seen as objective, but it's as subjective as the choices made when making a sonification

# Why Sound

Sound is emotive - words can be too, but the abrupt non-visual nature of sound in a heavily visual world tends to draw attention and make people stop and listen, at least for a bit. [[All Sound is Queer - Daniel]] says that you can't close your ears, but I dislike the assumed passivity of that. You can close your ears, or choose not to listen and hear (as an active verb), but sound does have an emotive quality that is challenging to replicate.

That is partly why I chose sound - both for its emotive potential, but also for its relative uncommonness, in academic work. Sound is making a [insurgence? resurgence?], yes; see the work of my cohort [cohortmates work], as well as [others]. But it's been a long time in the making.

Why sound in general - draw on phenomenology (Ingold?), Soria-Martinez 2017, etc.

# Why not include Indigenous music (why use silence)

Dylan Robinson, "Hungry Listening," 2020

- Begins with a quote from R. Murray Schafer; Robinson says that it 'sonifys compositional violence' and presents a 'settler desire for Indigenous "presentability" or "civility" as Indigenous throat songs (games) are processed through settler colonial musical logic' (Intro, pg1)

![[R.M.Schafer in Robinson, 2020.png]]

- in general, Robinson asks us to consider 'how your positionality guides the way you listen to musical activity'

- "listening is guided by positionality as an intersection of perceptual habit, ability, and bias." (Ch1, pg1)

*** for MRE, tie in my own positionality and how it's impossible to divorce the work from my own biases, actions, whiteness, gender, etc.

*** my MRE is a work that includes my whiteness, my queerness, my transness; it includes all my privileges and makes it an experience that isn't universal. Historical research itself shares that sameness with sound research, with whiteness and queerness and transness - no work is biasless, or objective. Our biases, our identities, our privileges are embedded in the work that we do, and it's necessary to recognize that and to acknowledge it. Research is subjective, archives are subjective, and data is subjective - and that's part of why I chose to label my work as sound art as opposed to something more historical. To acknowledge, in a way that historical practice alone rarely allows, that every part of this work is subjective and a result of a choice that I have made, or that others have made throughout history. And usually, the common thread there is whiteness, and settlerness. So in my work, I have tried to acknowledge those threads, and to explore how those threads both permeate my current work, as well as the history that I'm looking into. Steamboats are a tool of settler colonialism. Steamboat imperialism is a well-documented term globally, but one that we in Canada have rarely applied to ourselves [check this]. Instead, that term is used in [India, USA, etc. - find that article]. But, it applies here too.

In 19th century [first -indigenous name-, then -unnamed-, then -Bytown-, then -Ottawa-, then amalgamation], steamboats were a key tool in resource extraction, colonization, industrialization, and settlement [add more?].

[add timber trade materials, but connect to steamboats re: towing forwarding boats, paving the way for lumber barges?, carrying workers, serving as 'connections' - draw on Mackey].

Vandana Shiva, colonialism and steamboat imperialism;

go through each point and explain the connection.

[[Steamboats and Settler Colonialism]]

---

Returning to Robinson, there's a reason why I chose not to include Algonquin music in my work. R. Murray Schafer is regarded as the father of soundscapes. Incredibly paternalistic, that description, but he's a central figure. As Robinson points out, the violence in the quote is [inignorable]. The violence that Schafer perpetrated in that one quote likely continues in his soundscape work and instruction, and permeates the discipline. Soundscapes as a whole have the potential to be incredibly settler colonial. Acoustic ecology and many other sound fields do as well, and acknowledging this is the least we can do. Beyond that, refusing to continue to perpetrate the violence that Robinson brings to light, of 'compositional violence', the 'settler desire for Indigenous "presentability" or "civility"', and the violence created by processing Indigenous music (in Robinson's example, 'Indigenous throat songs (games)) as they are 'processed through settler colonial musical logic' (Robinson, 1).

Who am I, as a white settler, to decide that 'yes, this Anishinaabe piece is one that I will use'; who am I to impose my 'settler colonial musical logic' onto Indigenous music? (quotes from Robinson, 1). Even with the best of intentions, I do not feel confident in my ability to avoid causing harm; and so, I will choose to acknowlege the presence, history, and future of local Indigenous groups in this way:

Turtle Island belongs to many Indigenous nations. As white settlers, we have stolen land, resources, and people, and caused irreparable harm to all Indigenous nations, up to and including genocide. Locally, this territory belongs to the Algonquin Anishinaabe [and other groups?], as it has since time immemorial and as it continues to be. It was never ceded or surrendered, and nor have they been compensated for their land or for the destruction that we as white settlers have done. This MRE deals with a short and specific time period and focuses on the results of settler-colonialism, but while reading or interacting with this work, please remember that the Algonquin were here before, during, and after this period, and continue to be present on their land today. As reparation to the Algonquin, I ask that if you end up using my sound art experience, please consider donating to one of the initiatives lead by the Algonquins of Ontario (https://www.tanakiwin.com/current-initiatives/overview-of-current-initiatives/) or (French Algonquin nations??).

# Complicating western environmentalism

My research acknowledges the need for the complication of Western environmentalism. Western environmentalism tends to focus on the idea of a "return" - returning nature to what it was before. However, as per A. M. Kanngeiser, the "what it was" of that statment is deliberately vague.

- "The desire for the before-time must always obfuscate its conditions of production, to recognise them would mean to locate it in some context through which it cannot be sustained. In this kind of populist environmentalism from which nature is healing emerges, it is critical that the before-time is seen as pure, authentic" (A.M. Kanngeiser, 2021 - to return)

Regardless of the time period being discussed, nature has never been perfect. To claim it as so is to ignore the presence of Indigenous peoples on this land since time immemorial [find citation]. Nature has always been cultivated and selected - maybe not always intentionally, in the sense of domesticated agriculture - but it has always been influenced by human action and activities (and vice versa).

- "In the neoliberal sense called upon through the “Nature is healing” claims, which translate most often into conservation, what is being invoked is a more acute policing of nature. As Angela Last suggests, the moves to decentre the human in much ecological work has sought to “reconnect people with the Earth while ignoring their situatedness at sites of colonial trauma.”[14] (Quote Angela Last). Conservation efforts that displace and harm Indigenous communities show that the way nature is defined is contingent on division and eradication.[15]" (AM Kanngeiser, 2021)"

My work aims to take these thoughts into account, and avoid replicating the idea of 'nature as pure'. All sound pieces and thoughts should be understood as trying to express the [word] - not as inspiration or a call to action to return the land to what it was in the 1800s (unless we're talking about land-back, in which case we should absolutely do that), but instead to demonstrate how quickly we (white settlers) have deliberately crafted the landscape to further goals of imperialism, capitalism, and colonialism through steamboats, the timber trade, and settlement.

---------

Furthering that, it is also necessary to discuss borders. Borders, especially when mapped, are colonial. They are also arbitrary. For much of the history being discussed, the Ottawa River acts as a border between Ontario and Quebec. However, it’s not a neat line, and there are parts of Quebec on the south shore of the river, and parts of Ontario on the north. These arbitrary lines can make research a challenge – changing languages, archival organization and access, and even different provincial COVID-19 rules create challenges in trying to holistically look at the Ottawa River and this period of history.

- # Citations of Care

- 

- [[process-notes]]

- 

- This is a quick note to state my intentions: I want to use my citations as 'care,' following Sara N. Ahmed. I want to push the mainstream citations from old white men and go father into the field, to diversify my citations but also to cite who I want and who inspires me, as opposed to who people think I should cite.

- 

- I want this to be an experiment in sound, but also an experiment in citations.

- 

- queer ecology, black feminist ecology, queer sound theory, trans sound theory, feminist sound theory(?).

- 

- Queer, trans, Black diapora theory are not only for queer, trans, and Black diaspora topics. They can and should apply to the environment, ecology, sound, etc. I would say that my work does not go far enough, but I hope that it’s a useful contribution to citing authors who may not be traditionally cited. Hopefully, if someone ends up reading this MRE, they may find the authors useful and continue to cite them

This ideology of considering all sounds, including those usually discounted as noise, is similar to that of John Cage, who said that the use of electrical instruments “will make available for musical purposes any and all sounds that can be heard” (1961: 4).”
