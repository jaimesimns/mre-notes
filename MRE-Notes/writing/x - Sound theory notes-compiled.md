# Sound Theory
- imagining a soundwalk [1] using relational positioning, so that it can be located anywhere.
- except, more of an audiowalk (McCartney, 2010) due to focus on created over natural sound
- features a map [2] and a constantly running nature track to show that sound/nature is present with or without mediation/human presence [3.1]. Also ties into feminist sound theory/feminist cinematic theory [3.2] with considerations of gendered sound (linear vs looping) [3.3] as well as the gender disparity of soundwalks versus other sonic entanglements [3.4]
- Part A: *data sonifications* that run on top of the base track, triggered based on relation to where the person starts/the direction they face [4.1, 4.2].
- geosonifications [5.1, 5.2] of previously chosen archival data, but the sonifications feature auditory icons focused on industrial noise [6] and follow noise music theory [7.1, 7.2, 8]
- Polli states that soundwalks are in protest of constant industrial noise assaulting sonic environments, except I would like to do the reverse and take the base track of a natural sonic environment and reintroduce industrial noise as the sounds of data (ie: log footage from LAC)
- this has political implications [9, 10] and allows for a connection with acoustic ecology [11, 12] through the conjunction of the base track with the sonifications and the interplay of real and constructed environment through the noise backdrop and geosonifications.
- the choice to focus on auditory nature of an environment "defines historic and ongoing social relations of humans to that environment" [13.1, 13.2];
- my choice to focus noise versus music is deliberate and plays with traditional meanings of music vs noise-based soundscape [14]; can connect this to Ottawa Valley music traditions arriving from colonial settlement 
- Part B: potentially *image sonifications* turned into music (not based on auditory icons) would allow for the sonification of colonial imagery in the form of archival photos, but also connect with the colonial nature of settler music in the Ottawa Valley through the traditional meanings of music vs soundscape [see 14 again]; "amplification of the meaning" [15]
- I see this as alternating geosonification with image sonification in a vaguely rectangular section of the Ottawa River
- sonifications have been used with embodiment/interactive art installations [15]
- the use of Ottawa Valley-style music creates engagement at the auditory level with the history itself, not just with the image alone; returning sound to the visual image for a multisensory understanding of the past [16.1, 16.2]
- the role of silence/base audio in between reaching different sonifications [17]

# Auditory Icons

# Content Thoughts from Earlier

[[process-notes]]

I am thinking of using auditory icons in the sonification of the datasets (like https://egyptbuildingcollapses.org/) to use the semi-representative sound to evoke emotion (ie: bird noises disappearing over time to represent quantities of trees cut); my goal is to take the data sonification and move it from noise to {semi-pleasant} sound to talk about the affective quality/create an affective quality (also with art of the landscape similar to soundmarks; I really liked the interplay there). Also thinking of site-specific recordings (depending on car access, etc.) to work into the soundscape too to flesh it out. =={*current note: thinking of scaling it to a section of the SJAM pathway along the Ottawa River (a) bc colonial connection, (b) feasibility bc Dr. Graham suggested that an unmoored soundwalk may not be possible. From Portage Bridge to Champlain Bridge, perhaps? It's about an hours walk, so maybe that's too long? Not sure, need to think more. But, it would work well for the soundscape timing.*}==

My general plans for using the auditory icons, either with shipwreck data as a temporal base or a sonification of the closest shipwreck(s)? Still working on that, depending on if this will lead to one track or three tracks.

1. Chats Rapids (where the UOICo fonds records refer to, and a power station is now – paint landscape top-view pre and post dam/power station

a. Use the data sonification of the freight/passenger traffic with inaudible talking as the auditory icon?

i. Ambient noise of recordings from Fitzray Prov Park/Morris Island (probably from on the water/in the water since the data is water-focused)

ii. Also with a sonification of an image of the shipwreck(s) in that area? Or of the closest one? Or as the base of the track, if one track. Alex Fraser, 1942 almost at same spot, Pontiac, 1908, G. H. Perley, 1895, Mink, 1945, Weldon, after 1919

iii. Or as a temporal basing for the track based on shipwrecks sunk that year (1871-1872): Otter, 1870, Ann Sisson, 1871, Maggie Bell, 1874, Mary Ann, 1874, Forest Queen, 1874

(sorry, did not mean to bold those parts)

2. Chalk River Laboratories (nuclear archive data)

a. Use data sonification of whatever data I end up finding along with recorded noises

i. Find out more about what went on in that region for additional noise

ii. Sonification of shipwrecks in that area: Reliance, 1896 - almost at same spot, John Egan, 1882, or

iii. Time-focused; similar to creation of CRL in 1944: Mink, 1945, Beloeil, 1945, Alex Fraser, 1942

3. Temiskaming area/very northern-most point of the Ottawa River; something about logging and shift from hardwoods to softwoods; several records at LAC including summary of quantities passing through the Works (1894-1979); ICO log records from 1870-1894 from LAC; 1895-1903; 1904 – 1920; 1921 - 1935; timber records 1870-1992; Footage passing the works 1894-1979; ICO footage records 1870

i. Bird sounds or saw and pulp mills as appropriate for auditory icon

1. Forest composition pre- and post-industrialization! http://www.forestresearch.ca/Projects/Sustain/PICSiteRegionPublishedReportPintoetalCJFR2008July.pdf

ii. Sonification of shipwrecks in area: Aileen, 1914; Temiskaming, 1926; Meteor, 1926; Lady Minto, 1968, Wenona, Anne Marie, Wanakewan, Comet (1902)

If I go with the steamship images (if it’s split into three tracks), then I would use the pitch map of the photosounder of an image (not the direct sound) and not the direct photosounder sound, because in my tests with the Ann Sisson there was a lot of very similar noise and it’s very unpleasant to listen to, and (in my opinion) doesn’t really serve to create affect.

# Sonification and subjectivity of data

plays with the idea of the 'subjectivity'/'objectivity' of data - data is seen as objective, but it's as subjective as the choices made when making a sonification

# MIDItime

I am going to use MIDItime, as I don't intend to rely on synthetic instruments. Instead, I want to create my own 'instruments' through the use of samplers to express the noise icons that I desire. This way, I can turn bird noises into an instrument by mapping them by pitch, or saw noises, or remix the Ottawa Valley Reel to better express the meaning behind my data.

# Thesis

- main PH thesis: making the argument that a geolocated soundscape is an affective piece of public history

- main historical thesis: attending to the affective and emotional aspect of sound and place is an effective pedagogical experience for learning environmental history

 - history-wise: need to demonstrate that you know the kind of history that you are intersecting with ==draw on Joanna's broader historical comments, etc. bc she will probably be one of the readers==

 - include whatever archive/etc that you are sonifying/interacting with + ==context for why you want to sonify that stuff, sonify it, and then show why it matters/what you can take away from doing these things==

- blow-by-blow of MRE doesn't need to be in paper; can go in a GitHub repo instead

- the digital product doesn't need to match the paper timeline - it's the paper that you submit and its timeline that matters, but it should have enough of the product to help reviewers get a sense of how it is/will be done

 - can see what they're going for and how they're going to do it, how it intersects with theory and method, historiography that you've lifted, etc.

- length of paper (with a digital product) is 20-40 pages but content matters more

 - contextualising soundscape with geolocation in the context of public history will take several pages

 - discussing the logic of your piece and how it works and what it's meant to evoke will take several as well

- use my chart as figure 1

# Sound recording method

Sound equipment and travel are not covered by the Underhill fund, so I will use my phone. The video sound is better than the voice memo sound, so I will record videos and then use only the sound file from the video. I may include the video for some of the passages but that will depend on how good they are/if the videos are useful for expressing my point or not.
