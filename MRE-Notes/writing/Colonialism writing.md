"We will also encourage users to consider the links between these transatlantic connections brought by commodity exchanges and the process of settler colonialism. Timber ships provided cheap passage to European immigrants travelling to North America, increasing the settler population. Logging camps pushed deep into unceded Algonquin territory. The creation of a wheat exporting economy in Saskatchewan coincided with dispossession and starvation of the Cree, Nakota, Dakota, and Lakota, the pass system, and residential schools that followed on the plains. We’ll encourage the audience to consider how this context shapes the futures they want to create. Can we continue to allow geography to hide the consequences of our actions?"
- note how the "timber ships provided cheap passage to European immigrants travelling to North America, increasing the settler population."; they could then catch rides on steamboats to go up the Ottawa River or along the St. Lawrence
- the drive for timber encouraged settlers and "Logging camps [to push]] into unceded Algonquin territory" with the help of steamboats and tugs

## The Settler Sea (TBV)
Ideally, this MRE could be like "The Settler Sea: California's Salton Sea and the Consequences of Colonialism" by Traci Brynne Voyles - tracing various periods in the Ottawa River's history to examine how "how settler colonialism restructures physical environments in ways that further Indigenous dispossession, racial capitalism, and degradation of the natural world. In other words, _The Settler Sea_ asks how settler colonialism entraps nature to do settlers' work for them" (book cover/Amazon description).

"The history of the Salton Sea can most clearly be understood as a physical manifestation of settler colonial power; settler colonialism, in turn, can be tracked in terms of its physical consequences for landscapes as well as people"(TBV's c.13)

"'Settler colonialism' refers to a set of power relations that seeks to colonize Indigenous peoples and claim their homelands as settlers' own through intersecting forces of racism, sexism, heteronormativity, environmental degradation, dispossession, ableism, and capitalism" (TBV's c.14). 

"Settler colonialism is... a web of relationships that reinforces white supremacy, control over land, exploitation of racialized workers, and unsustainable resource use for capitalism accumulation" (TBV, 1)

"The functions of social power built into settler colonial processes - racism, sexism, classism, heteropatriarchy, ableism - are *themselves* environmentally ruinuous" (TBV, -)

"century-long mismanagement of the Salton Sea has constituted a manifestation of 'ecological imperialism'" (TBV's c.21).

"colonization has had a 'biological, an ecological component'" (TBV's c.21 or c.20, probably)

Environmental histories often center around water. "Historians assert that such preoccupation... emerged with water's role as a metaphor and vehicle for power" (TBV's c.23 and c.24)

In Canada, wealth has flowed down rivers and on bodies of water (TBV 'where water and desert meet').
- "lumbering follow[ed] the natural waterways" which allowed logs to be floated out and supplies to be freighted in (Tatley, 1996, pg 55)
The Ottawa River is no exception. "The manipulation of nature and the transformation of great rivers into organic machines that created hydraulic empires in the West have organized the power of the settler colonial nation state and a great many of its citizens" (TBV c.24; "The organic machine," Matt Evendon, Joy Parr, etc.). 


***Settler Colonialism


"Settler colonialism has been understood by scholars as being ... about *land*" (TBV, -); Glen Coulthard: settler colonialism is "a structure of domination predicated on dispossession" (TBV's c.35)

But it also more complicated than that - 

"Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabe scholar Vanessa Watts incisively negates Western preoccupations with separating ontology from epistemology, knowing from being, and place from story. As a person from the Great Lakes region of North America, she unfolds an Indigenous conception of onto-epistemology: [H]abitats and ecosystems are better understood as societies from an Indigenous point of view; meaning that they have ethical structures, inter-species treaties and agreements, and further their ability to interpret, understand and implement. Non-human beings are active members of society. Not only are they active, they also directly influence how humans organize themselves into that society. . . . Human thought and action are therefore derived from a literal expression of particular places and historical events in Haudenosaunee and Anishnaabe cosmologies.[2]" [[Kanngeiser and Zoe S. Todd]]"

"Mohawk scholar Sandra Styres understands place and Land as correlational but notes that the denotation of Land moves far beyond what Western thought attributes to place. She explains: ==Place refers to physical geographic space and is defined by everything that is included in that space—also referred to as landscape, ecology, and/or environment—and is denoted as land (lower case “l”). Connected but distinct, Land (capital “L”) is more than physical geographic space. Land expresses a duality that refers not only to place as a physical geographic space but also to the underlying conceptual principles, philosophies, and ontologies of that space.== This duality is not to be construed as dichotomous, oppositional, or binarial but rather expresses the ways Land embodies two simultaneously interconnected and interdependent conceptualizations. Land as an Indigenous philosophical construct is both space (abstract) and place/land (concrete); it is also conceptual, experiential, relational, and embodied. Placefulness is not something independent from Land but exists within the nuanced contexts of Land. . . . Land is more than the diaphanousness of inhabited memories; Land is spiritual, emotional, and relational; Land is experiential, (re)membered, and storied; Land is consciousness—Land is sentient." ([[Kanngeiser and Zoe S. Todd]])

"Drawing on these examples, it is crucial to reflect on Land and place as sets of relationships between human and nonhuman beings, co-constituting one another. Acknowledging this requires historians studying environmental issues to address the importance of maintaining ethical and reciprocal relationships with Land and place (and all the co-constituents thereof). Anishinaabe scholar Nicholas J. Reo thus articulates what he calls a “kincentric” environmental studies praxis,4 drawing on the work of Enrique Salmón5 : When researchers focus their attention on building and maintaining relationships, the connection between ontology and epistemology in ethnobiology becomes more clear. Rather than pondering what plant ontologies might look like, we can speak to plants. Whether or not as individual researchers we are ready to speak and listen to plants (or animals) directly in our work, we can set up our research collaborations, professional meetings, and classes in ways that make room for and value Indigeneity.6 Such conceptualizations help us critique the way that specific places in Canada and the Pacific have become talking points and data-sheds for scholars in the Global North and colonial academe as they seek to investigate global climate and environmental crises through the past and into the present. Watts, Reo, and Styres demonstrate the need to recognize and respect relationships imbricated through human interactions with specific places. Place, a nonhuman being, is sentient and active. One place cannot stand in for another, as each place is formed through ongoing reciprocal relations. In contrast, Western scholars render places like the Tar Sands in Alberta or the Marshall Islands in the central Pacific Ocean as “case types of the Anthropocene,” which are instrumentalized as metaphors for larger processes and dislocated from their peoples and cultures." [[Kanngeiser and Zoe S. Todd]]"


"As Dian Million, Winona LaDuke, Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, and Kyle Powys White have argued, seeing land and territory as the zero-sum game of Indigenous struggles against settler colonialism is not enough; it runs the risk of centering the property orientation of settlers as the principal politics of decolonization" (TBV's c.38).

"Settler colonialism has sought a dual strategy of colonizing land and superimposing settler *relations* on that land" (TBV)

 "If landforms like the Salton Sea function in ways that maintain and advance the dispossessive and exploitative nature of settler colonialism, it extends what we can think of as cases of environmental justice."

 Jaskiron Dhillon - environmental justice positioned "within historical, social, political, and economic contexts and larger structures of power that foreground the relationships among settler colonialism, nature, and planetary devastation" (TVB's c.49?)

 "Environmental justice, in this framework, encompasses not just demands for redistribution but demands for decolonizing settler relations to nature as well as to Indigenous people and territory" (TVB's c.49).

 "... settler colonialism has restructured nature in the form of 'organic machines' that then themselves produce the outcomes of settler power over people and nature" (TVB)

 Like the Salton Sea, the Ottawa River has thematic chronologies. Deep time & time immemorial, early colonial exploration, settlement, steamboats, timber trade, canals, mining, dams & nuclear, modernity

## Why Steamboats
Our Steamboat Imperialism - Maya Jasanoff (https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2013/10/10/our-steamboat-imperialism/)

"Steamboats were to nineteenth-century empire-builders what caravels had been to the conquistadores, and what satellites and drones are to us: they extended political and economic power into hitherto inaccessible regions.

In China, the British East India Company used steam-powered gunboats to wage the Opium Wars and secure access to inland waterways and markets. In the Middle East, steamships opened the Red Sea, Euphrates, and Tigris to reliable commercial navigation, dramatically reducing the travel time between Asia and Europe, and raising European imperial interest in the region. In Africa, river steamers achieved what centuries of coastal trade had not, by penetrating the interior for European commerce—and colonization—up the Niger, the Zambesi, the Nile, and, of course, the Congo.

But it was in North America that “steamboat imperialism” came into its own. It was here that Robert Fulton had first demonstrated the commercial potential of steamships, with boats on the Hudson that could take you from New York to Albany in about thirty hours, while a stagecoach took days. In 1811 Fulton launched the first commercially successful steamboat on the Mississippi. By 1820, sixty-nine steamers plied the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. A generation later, there were 740. [](https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2013/10/10/our-steamboat-imperialism/#fn-*) Steamboats powered the push of white settlement into Indian territory, and facilitated the commercial development of the Mississippi Valley into perhaps the most profitable land in the world. The “Cotton Kingdom” was created by steamboat imperialism."

"Enthusiasts saw steamboats as “a _deus ex machina_” for “imperialism and dispossession” and modernization."

"The steamboat, with its power to travel both with and against the flow of rivers, enabled Europeans to push into the interior of Africa (and many parts of Asia as well).  Steamboats were soon armed with small cannons, giving rise to the term “gunboat.”  In turn, when Europeans began steaming into harbors from Hong Kong to the Congo and demanding territory and trading privileges, the term “gunboat diplomacy” was invented, the quintessential example of which was in the unwilling concession to western contact and trade on the part of Japan, considered below.""

![Photograph of a small steamship in the Belgian Congo.](https://pressbooks.nscc.ca/app/uploads/sites/59/2020/07/image53.jpg)

"A typical small and, in this case, unarmed steamship on the Congo River in Central Africa.  “Steamers” as they were called varied greatly in size and armaments."

==while steamers on the Ottawa River were generally larger and had different construction, they still followed this logic of using new technology (steam) to penetrate previously inaccessible territory in an effort to exploit and extract natural resources, settle land (Indigenous dispossession), and [something about forcing European social values/religion/etc.]

Also briefly mention the use of steamboats on the Great Lakes (find their uses) and their ties to racial segregation/white supremacy? (history of Black porters/find the right word on the steamships); also mention the use of steamships by Wilson to bring Indigenous children to his residential schools (cite Natalie's thesis; ask her which papers).

Also the clergy's use of steamers to travel up the ottawa; see the ledger



--
Besides the use of the same technology, it was also (broadly) many of the same people perpetuating this steamboat imperialism and settler colonialism. The British and the Americans were two major groups; interestingly, most of the steamboat captains and crew were British or American, who then brought their friends to join them. Many French Canadians worked on the St. Lawrence, but not so much on the Ottawa River. (*also find that thesis about Indigenous men working on the steamers*)
- same as with the loggers, many of them had ties to countries that practiced resource-extractive colonialism like Britain
- one interesting (and unusual) piece of evidence that connects them are songs - many Canadian logging songs share tunes with British pub songs, which can also be traced to Australian sheep-shearing songs and the American national anthem, whose tune is also known as "The Anacreontic Song" or "To Anacreon in Heaven" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anacreontic_Song; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydAIdVKv84g). Many of the same 'calls' (like 'come all ye fellows') appear in these songs, regardless of country.
- During its early [western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_civilisation "Western civilisation") history, Australia was a collection of British colonies, and [Australian folk music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_folk_music "Australian folk music") and [bush ballads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_ballad "Bush ballad") such as "[Waltzing Matilda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltzing_Matilda "Waltzing Matilda")" were heavily influenced by [Anglo-Celtic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Celtic_Australian "Anglo-Celtic Australian") traditions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Australia) [[Australian colonial folk music]]
