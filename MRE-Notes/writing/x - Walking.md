==Walking==

Ottawa's walking paths are carefully cultivated. They tend to be in "nature"-based areas, which indicate that the city is cognizant of how urbanized much of the city is.[55] The city's walking paths also tend to be littered with sign posts and reading material, often referring to certain aspects of the city's past or its current ecological niches. The paths are part of the city's urban policies, and serve as a method of promoting specific aspects of heritage as they intersect with tourism demands.

Ottawa is full of historical plaques, scultures, reading panels, which can usefully be summed up as 'heritagisation' (following Svensson, 2021), especially as you get closer to Parliament. Ottawa's sense of place as 'the capital of Canada' is reflected both in the increasing number of plaques, historical monuments, panels, etc. as well as in the content of those heritage [things?]. Most focus on important moments in [white, colonial] Canadian history, prioritizing sanitized narratives of upper-class white settlers, politicians, business owners, etc. [find diversity stats on Ottawa's heritage content?]

Things are beginning to change, especially with the rise of community-created projects meant to tell their own histories, but there's still very much the idea of Ottawa's heritage only referring to Ottawa as the nation's capital. It's a very shiny history, and one that hides a much rougher and more working-class heritage.

This project argues that exploring geolocated soundscapes via walking is an affective piece of public history, and that attending to the affective and emotional aspect of sound and place is an effective pedagogical experience for learning history.

Walking can be "an act of resistance, defiance and critique of official urban politics and heritage work" and is a major way that people "engage with and experience heritage" (Svensson, 2021; also see Solnit [2001](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.library.carleton.ca/doi/full/10.1080/13527258.2020.1821240#); Wang and Kao [2017](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.library.carleton.ca/doi/full/10.1080/13527258.2020.1821240#) ). Walking draws attention to place, and the performative and transformative nature of heritagization. Ottawa is full of constructed heritage - not solely as in heritage buildings, but as in a heritage narrative that has been carefully constructed and construed. The official narrative is sanitized, shiny, and neat; easily sold for tourism and to encourage government officials and public servants to continue to enjoy the city. Even the city's motto, "Canada in one city," reflects this preference for remembering Ottawa's history as a federal center (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/city-ottawa-new-slogan-canada-in-one-city-1.5176001; https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/canada-in-one-city-a-new-slogan-for-our-million-strong-capital).

"Walking can in these contexts also become an act of resistance, defiance and critique of official urban politics and heritage work (e.g. ). Walking, in other words, can be a method to both discover and transform the city, and also a method to challenge urban developments and policies.""

What does this mean for a city like Ottawa, where the heritage is hidden? What happens when we bring forward the hidden past, and ask people to reengage with it?

"City developments and heritigization do not only change modes of walking but may also stimulate more conscious forms of walking, including what has been referred to as conceptual walking, that engages with and/or challenges these developments" (svensson).
- this walk is meant to present various aspects of early Ottawa-and-area history that challenge the official narrative and present some of the less 'shiny' aspects of the past (aka Ottawa as a working class city)

"Who engages in walking and when and where can be differentiated by age, gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status, and walking is thus a negotiated and often contested practice that reveals power relations and inequalities in society. In Walter Benjamin’s work the _flâneur_ exemplified both the emergence of a new way of walking among certain individuals as well as changes in the city itself" (Benjamin 2002)
- connect this with changes in Ottawa, with LeBreton Flats, Mechanicsville and Meranda's project, etc.
