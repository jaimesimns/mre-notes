Dylan Robinson, "Hungry Listening," 2020

- Begins with a quote from R. Murray Schafer; Robinson says that it 'sonifys compositional violence' and presents a 'settler desire for Indigenous "presentability" or "civility" as Indigenous throat songs (games) are processed through settler colonial musical logic' (Intro, pg1)
![[R.M.Schafer in Robinson, 2020.png]]
- in general, Robinson asks us to consider 'how your positionality guides the way you listen to musical activity'
- "listening is guided by positionality as an intersection of perceptual habit, ability, and bias." (Ch1, pg1)

*** for MRE, tie in my own positionality and how it's impossible to divorce the work from my own biases, actions, whiteness, gender, etc. 
*** my MRE is a work that includes my whiteness, my queerness, my transness; it includes all my privileges and makes it an experience that isn't universal. Historical research itself shares that sameness with sound research, with whiteness and queerness and transness - no work is biasless, or objective. Our biases, our identities, our privileges are embedded in the work that we do, and it's necessary to recognize that and to acknowledge it. Research is subjective, archives are subjective, and data is subjective - and that's part of why I chose to label my work as sound art as opposed to something more historical. To acknowledge, in a way that historical practice alone rarely allows, that every part of this work is subjective and a result of a choice that I have made, or that others have made throughout history. And usually, the common thread there is whiteness, and settlerness. So in my work, I have tried to acknowledge those threads, and to explore how those threads both permeate my current work, as well as the history that I'm looking into. Steamboats are a tool of settler colonialism. Steamboat imperialism is a well-documented term globally, but one that we in Canada have rarely applied to ourselves [check this]. Instead, that term is used in [India, USA, etc. - find that article]. But, it applies here too. 

In 19th century [first -indigenous name-, then -unnamed-, then -Bytown-, then -Ottawa-, then amalgamation], steamboats were a key tool in resource extraction, colonization, industrialization, and settlement [add more?].

[add timber trade materials, but connect to steamboats re: towing forwarding boats, paving the way for lumber barges?, carrying workers, serving as 'connections' - draw on Mackey].

Vandana Shiva, colonialism and steamboat imperialism;

go through each point and explain the connection.

Returning to Robinson, there's a reason why I chose not to include Algonquin music in my work. R. Murray Schafer is regarded as the father of soundscapes. Incredibly paternalistic, that description, but he's a central figure. As Robinson points out, the violence in the quote is [inignorable]. The violence that Schafer perpetrated in that one quote likely continues in his soundscape work and instruction, and permeates the discipline. Soundscapes as a whole have the potential to be incredibly settler colonial. Acoustic ecology and many other sound fields do as well, and acknowledging this is the least we can do. Beyond that, refusing to continue to perpetrate the violence that Robinson brings to light, of 'compositional violence', the 'settler desire for Indigenous "presentability" or "civility"', and the violence created by processing Indigenous music (in Robinson's example, 'Indigenous throat songs (games)) as they are 'processed through settler colonial musical logic' (Robinson, 1).

Who am I, as a white settler, to decide that 'yes, this Anishinaabe piece is one that I will use'; who am I to impose my 'settler colonial musical logic' onto Indigenous music? (quotes from Robinson, 1). Even with the best of intentions, I do not feel confident in my ability to avoid causing harm; and so, I will choose to acknowlege the presence, history, and future of local Indigenous groups in this way:
Turtle Island belongs to many Indigenous nations. As white settlers, we have stolen land, resources, and people, and caused irreparable harm to all Indigenous nations, up to and including genocide. Locally, this territory belongs to the Algonquin Anishinaabe [and other groups?], as it has since time immemorial and as it continues to be. It was never ceded or surrendered, and nor have they been compensated for their land or for the destruction that we as white settlers have done. This MRE deals with a short and specific time period and focuses on the results of settler-colonialism, but while reading or interacting with this work, please remember that the Algonquin were here before, during, and after this period, and continue to be present on their land today. As reparation to the Algonquin, I ask that if you end up using my sound art experience, please consider donating to one of the initiatives lead by the Algonquins of Ontario (https://www.tanakiwin.com/current-initiatives/overview-of-current-initiatives/) or (French Algonquin nations??).

It's hard to create time for thinking and feeling, in academia, in an MA program, when there's so much to do and so much more that people tell you you should be doing. But I wanted this work to be full of feeling, and it's hard to do that when you're emotionally numb. Pandemics don't make that any easier, but I hope that the feelings that I tried to put into the work makes you feel something. For most of you, I won't prescribe how you should feel (following Robinson, again). But for those reading this who are white, I hope that you feel something about the damage that we have done, both to Indigenous people and to the environment in the pursuit of capitalism. [maybe too Romantic; come back and see if I want to include or not]

Sound is emotive - words can be too, but the abrupt non-visual nature of sound in a heavily visual world tends to draw attention and make people stop and listen, at least for a bit. [[All Sound is Queer - Daniel]] says that you can't close your ears, but I dislike the assumed passivity of that. You can close your ears, or choose not to listen and hear (as an active verb), but sound does have an emotive quality that is challenging to replicate. 

That is partly why I chose sound - both for its emotive potential, but also for its relative uncommonness, in academic work. Sound is making a [insurgence? resurgence?], yes; see the work of my cohort [cohortmates work], as well as [others]. But it's been a long time in the making. 

Why sound in general - draw on phenomenology (Ingold?), Soria-Martinez 2017, etc.




Thoughts on why:



















But also: [maybe not - cut section
- history departments, and historical research (historically), are a very white, very colonial institution. The research that they privilege, and the people that they privilege, have for many decades (centuries?) been white. Diversity exists in contemporary universities, and there are many folks who are making major changes - [list BIPOC/racialized history profs], but universities as an institution rarely encourage that work to the same degree that they do for white researchers, historians, professors, etc. // Historical research, and history departments within universities as colonial institutions, are very white - both in research and in researchers. Other fields, such as art, are considerably more diverse.]
