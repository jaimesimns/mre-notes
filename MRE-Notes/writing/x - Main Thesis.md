==Main Thesis==
- This project argues that geolocated soundscapes are an affective piece of public history, and that attending to the affective and emotional aspect of sound and place is an effective pedagogical experience for learning [environmental?] history.

- walking as "an act of resistance, defiance and critique of official urban politics and heritage work" (Svensson, 2021); see [[x-reflection on walking]]





==Historical part==

==Primary sources==

	- history-wise: need to demonstrate that you know the kind of history that you are intersecting with ==draw on Joanna's broader historical comments, etc. bc she will probably be one of the readers==
	- include whatever archive/etc that you are sonifying/interacting with + ==context for why you want to sonify that stuff, sonify it, and then show why it matters/what you can take away from doing these things==
- blow-by-blow of MRE doesn't need to be in paper; can go in a GitHub repo instead
- the digital product doesn't need to match the paper timeline - it's the paper that you submit and its timeline that matters, but it should have enough of the product to help reviewers get a sense of how it is/will be done
	- can see what they're going for and how they're going to do it, how it intersects with theory and method, historiography that you've lifted, etc. 
- length of paper (with a digital product) is 20-40 pages but content matters more
	- contextualising soundscape with geolocation in the context of public history will take several pages
	- discussing the logic of your piece and how it works and what it's meant to evoke will take several as well
