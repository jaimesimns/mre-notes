==City developments and changes such as gentrification, tourism and heritagisation, inevitably have different implications for different groups of people and their walking practices, and walking as a research method can serve as a window to understand these changes. Walking can in these contexts also become an act of resistance, defiance and critique of official urban politics and heritage work (e.g. Solnit [2001](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.library.carleton.ca/doi/full/10.1080/13527258.2020.1821240#); Wang and Kao [2017](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.library.carleton.ca/doi/full/10.1080/13527258.2020.1821240#)). Walking, in other words, can be a method to both discover and transform the city, and also a method to challenge urban developments and policies.==
**this works well with Ottawa, a city filled with "official urban politics and heritage work". Ottawa plays up the nice, clean heritage aspects and focuses on its role as the capital of Canada, but ignores its start as a rough working town that played a large part in the timber trade, steamboat industry, wrecking the Ottawa, the shanty towns, etc. Very little official monuments
