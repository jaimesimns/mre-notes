## Pre-industrial landscape composition patterns and post-industrial changes at the temperate–boreal forest interface in western Quebec, Canada 
Victor Danneyrolles, Dominique Arseneault & Yves Bergeron; 2016

- Location: An area of 4175 km2 at the temperate–boreal forest interface of southwest Quebec, Canada; ==Témiskaminque region in Southwestern Quebec, 47°300 N, 79°000 W; Figure 1a==
- Methods: Reconstruction of the pre-industrial composition is based on an original early land survey data set (1874–1935). Composition changes were computed by comparing historical data with modern forest inventories. 
- Results: Pre-industrial forest composition was structured across the landscape by the combination of environmental gradients (topography, deposits, drainage, etc.) and recurrence of fire. Frequency and intensity of fires were most likely the main drivers of forest dynamics and composition across the landscape. Black spruce (Picea mariana) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea) dominated hilly areas affected by former fires; aspen (Populus tremuloides) dominated lowlands following recent fire. White cedar (Thuja occidentatlis) and pines (Pinus spp.) dominated areas probably affected by small surface fires. New disturbance regimes that were subsequently incurred by human activities have shifted the pre-industrial landscape mosaic and have led to the current landscapes. ==Composition changes included a replacement of conifers by early successional species within settled or burned areas, and the maintenance of conifers and an increase in cedar dominance in areas affected by partial disturbance.==
- The study area covers 4175 km2 in the Témiscamingue region, which is located in southwestern Quebec (47°300 N, 79°000 W; Fig. 1a).

- Mixed forests in the region represent the transition zone between northern temperate hardwood and southern boreal conifer-dominated forests (Rowe 1972), and which corresponds to the balsam fir– yellow birch bioclimatic domain according to the provincial classification system (Robitaille & Saucier 1998). Surface deposits are mainly divided between clays deposited by the pro-glacial Barlow Lake in lowland areas (Vincent & Hardy 1977) and glacial till along with rocky outcrops in upland areas.
- "Native populations have occupied the study area for at least 5000 yrs (Riopel 2002). The Algonquin/Anishinaabe tribes were nomadic hunter-gatherers, and totalled from about 800 to a few thousand individuals (Couture 1983; Riopel 2002), but their impact on the forest remains unknown. From the 18th century, the region was frequented by Euro-Americans, who were engaged in the fur trade. Logging did not begin until 1840, and was mainly focused on selective cutting of tall pine trees until 1917 (Riopel 2002). From 1917 until the end of the 20th century, partial cutting of spruces (Picea spp.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea) for wood pulp became the main logging activity following the construction of a paper mill in the city of Temiscaming (Lienert 1966). Clear-cutting practices emerged with the mechanization of forestry in the 1970s. European settlement evolved in parallel with the forest industry, and the Euro-American population grew from a few hundred people in 1890 to nearly 30 000 in 1950 (Riopel 2002)." (471)

### Database Construction
- This study is based on ==36 logbooks from the surveys of 16 townships and ten forest concessions by 16 different surveyors between 1874 and 1935.== In the province of Quebec, public lands were divided into townships of about 16 km 9 16 km (10 miles 9 10 miles) and further subdivided into parallel ranges that were 1.6-km wide. Surveys were conducted along the boundaries of the township and range lines. Forest concessions varied in size, but only their boundaries were surveyed. Three observation types concerning forests are found in these archives: taxon lists (e.g. pine, spruce, white birch and a few maples), forest cover types (e.g. hardwood, softwood, etc.) and disturbance observations (e.g. burned, windthrow, etc.). In this study, only observations that mentioned taxa were selected.
- The historical database comprises 5207 observations that are unevenly spread across the study area (Fig. 1b), and which mention at least one tree taxon. Observations are divided into two geometric types: (1) line descriptions that clearly indicate a beginning and an end, and (2) regularly or irregularly distributed point observations along the surveyed lines. In order to incorporate these two observation types into the same database, point observations were weighted, based on their mean spacing (mean of distances to the previous and next observations), while the weight of each line description corresponded to its lengths (Dupuis et al. 2011). For all observations, a rank was assigned to each taxon listed according to its position in the taxon list, assuming that this position reflects their relative basal area (Terrail et al. 2014). These data were then precisely georeferenced as lines or points with modern cadastral maps built from these early land surveys. To assess changes between pre-industrial and modern composition, data from the historical survey records were compared with the Quebec government’s forest inventories from the last three decades (1980, 1990 and 2000). These inventories are based on 0.04-ha plots that are distributed proportionally according to the surface area of different types of productive forest stands (capable of producing at least 30 m3 ha1 timber in <120 yrs). Within the plots, all stems >2 cm DBH (1.3 m) of each species are measured and inventoried, and used here to calculate basal area (m2 ha1 ) by species. Finally, a rank was assigned to each taxon according to its relative basal area within modern plots. Some species (spruces, maples, pines, poplars) within the modern database were grouped at the genus level to match the taxa mentioned by surveyors. Taxa mentioned in less than 5% of taxon lists of both historical and modern databases were grouped as ‘others.'

### Discussion
- Pre-industrial composition and vegetation changes at the regional scale Our results show a regional strong increase in early successional (poplars, paper birch) and mid-successional (maples) deciduous taxa at the expense of pre-industrial dominant conifers (mainly spruces and fir). Regional preindustrial forest composition and post-industrial changes similar to our study area have been widely documented across eastern temperate and boreal North America (Siccama 1971; Lorimer 1977; Abrams 1998; Burgi et al. 2000; € Jackson et al. 2000; Dyer 2001; Cogbill et al. 2002; Friedman & Reich 2005; Pinto et al. 2008; Dupuis et al. 2011; Thompson et al. 2013). Studies in northern Europe have reported a post-industrial rejuvenation of forest landscapes, although modern forest management and intentional suppression of deciduous trees have shifted composition from mixed to coniferous forest (Ostlund € et al. 1997; Axelsson et al. 2002; Lilja & Kuuluvainen 2005). The land survey records used in this study were conducted from the end of the Little Ice Age (Mann & Jones 2003; Moberg et al. 2005; Gennaretti et al. 2014). Regional annual mean temperatures have since increased by approximately 1 °C (http://berkeleyearth.lbl.gov/locations/47.42N-79.34W, accessed 23 Jul 2015). Eastern Canadian climate has also become moister (Tardif & Bergeron 1997; Zhang et al. 2000; Girardin et al. 2004) and, combined with fire suppression policies, has led to a sharp decrease in fire frequency (Bergeron & Archambault 1993; Bergeron et al. 2006). Such changes could have shifted regional composition from cold-adapted to warm-adapted taxa and from fire-adapted to fire-sensitive taxa (Nowacki & Abrams 2008; Hanberry et al. 2012). However, these climate-related changes do not seem to have significantly influenced our results since the taxa having experienced the greatest increase (poplars and paper birch) are boreal fire-adapted species (Perala 1991; Safford et al. 1991). Increase in prevalence of maples (mostly red maple, Acer rubrum; according to modern inventories) could be due to rising temperatures (Tremblay et al. 2002; Fisichelli et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2015) and have also been associated with the decrease in fire activity (Nowacki & Abrams 2008). On the other hand, red maple is a ‘super generalist’ species that is largely favoured by disturbance (Walter & Yawney 1991; Abrams 1998; Fei & Steiner 2009), even including fire at its northern range limit in the study area (Zhang et al. 2015). Pre-industrial composition at the landscape scale Spatially constrained clustering analysis highlights spatial structure in pre-industrial composition at the landscape scale (Fig. 2a). Most of the study area was dominated by spruces (Group 1a). Currently, black spruce (Picea mariana) is the main species in the study area, so it is very likely that it also dominated the pre-industrial landscape. Abundant glacial and rocky deposits in this hilly region and frequent fires in the pre-industrial period (Grenier et al. 2005) promoted black spruce due to its semi-serotinous cones that allow it to establish after fires (Viereck 1983; Viereck & Johnston 1990) and to maintain strong dominance in the landscape (De Grandpre et al. 2000; Pham et al. 2004; Bouchard et al. 2008; Cyr et al. 2012). The area that was dominated by trembling aspen (currently the main species present in the area, Group 4a) in the pre-industrial landscape corresponded to an early successional stage and, in fact, was described as an area of ‘old burnt’ by surveyors in the 1880s (data not shown), which probably corresponded to a 1870s fire. Trembling aspen is a fire-adapted species and is favoured by lacustrine clay deposits (Bergeron & Charron 1994; Bergeron 2000) that are abundant in these lowland area. 
- Finally, the area co-dominated by white cedar and pines in the pre-industrial period represents a contradictory association (Group 3a). White cedar is a fire-sensitive and shade-tolerant late successional species (Johnston 1990; Hofmeyer et al. 2009), while white pine (Pinus strobus) and red pine (Pinus resinosa), which are currently the main pine species in this area, are fire-adapted species (Wendel & Smith 1990; Flannigan 1993; Abrams 2001). Small-scale surface fires could maintain uneven-aged stands of white pine (Quinby 1991; Abrams 2001), and could also allow the maintenance of white cedar in the landscape. Landscapes surrounding large lakes such as Lake Temiscamingue may show strong spatial variation in terms of fire frequency and intensity compared to adjacent main land landscapes (Bergeron 1991; Drobyshev et al. 2010) and could therefore explain the occurrence of small surface fires in this area.
