## A Forest History of Eastern Ontario

### 1.1 Forests and Their History
- "A few centuries ago eastern North America was covered by deciduous forests. Similar forests once covered western Europe and eastern Asia. These forests were remnants of the great Arctotertiary forests which, for millions of years, covered much of the Northern Hemisphere. These original forests are largely gone. Remnants persist in three forms: extensive areas of second growth recovering from past logging and agricultural practices, tiny fragments thought to represent fragments of virgin forest, and the occasional larger protected area. In the Eastern Ontario Model Forest (MF) region, we have no large protected areas (two of the larger being Carillon Provincial Park and Murphy's Point Provincial Park at approximately 1,400 ha), and no known remnants of virgin forest (although Shaw Woods is nearby in Renfrew County). 2 ==The early loggers and settlers were just too efficient.== There are, however, some areas of maturing forest, and some of these may approximate the early forests in certain limited ways. Some of them may return to historical conditions if managed appropriately. The best remaining deciduous forest in North America, and quite possibly the best in the world, occurs in Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the United States. It is impossible to fully appreciate eastern Ontario forests without visiting the forests of the southern Appalachians. It is stunning to see mile after mile of hill sides covered in mature forests, with our familiar sugar maple and hemlock trees growing mixed with unfamiliar southern species such as tulip trees and species of magnolia.
- Eastern Ontario lies near the northern edge of the deciduous forest region (Barnes 1991, Braun 1950; Fig. 1). Owing to the severity of the climate, we have only a few common tree species -- a fraction of the number which occur in the southern Appalachians. Typically, the commonest tree species in a mature stand of upland forest would be sugar maple, and beech followed by basswood, red maple, yellow birch, hemlock and white ash (Rowe 1972). Others found in lesser abundance would include red oak, bur oak, bitternut hickory, and butternut. The type of forest which occurs on a site is strongly influenced by bedrock and the post glacial deposits which cover it. These are used as a template to reconstruct eastern Ontario forests. A brief overview of geology and physiography follows." (2)

### Geological Context
- One of the most important factors affecting the natural and human history of eastern Ontario is bedrock. The western edge of the MF region is underlain by the Precambrian Shield (Fig. 2, Algonquin Section). The Shield is made up of some of the most ancient rocks on Earth-- some close to 4 billion years old. It occupies more than 4.5 million square kilometres of Canada. Granite and gneiss are the most common rocks here (Chapman and Putnam 1984); both are very hard and produce thin, acidic soils. The shield prevented the spread of agriculture and was an obstacle to the construction of roads and railroads


### Physiographic Context
-  The nature of the landforms of an area (topography, soils, drainage) influence the forest cover present. The physiographic regions of eastern Ontario shown in Figure 2 will be used as the framework for reconstructing past forest cover (see section 2.2.2) and therefore need to be briefly introduced here. These regions represent precambrian shield (bedrock) overlain with shallow till, precambrian shield with clay deposits (Leeds Knobs and Flats), limestone plains, till plains, clay plains, till and clay plains (Lancaster Flats), sand plains, and clay and sand plains with drumlins (North Gower Drumlin Field). Each is briefly described below (Chapman and Putnam 1984).
-  The first two have precambrian bedrock. Precambrian: Ridges of precambrian bedrock may be exposed or covered by deposits of shallow till. Leeds Knobs and Flats: Channels between knobs of precambrian bedrock are filled with clay. The deep soils are good for agriculture. The remainder have palaeozoic bedrock. Smiths Falls Limestone Plain: This is the largest and most continuous tract of shallow soil over limestone in southern Ontario. Due to gentle gradients, drainage is poor and swamps are numerous. Remnants of old marine beaches often provide the only areas of deep soil for cultivation or for road construction materials. Edwardsburg Sand Plain: The bedrock and most of the boulder clay are covered by sand. The sand surface is largely level with hummocks or ridges in some places. The soils are acid and deficient in nutrients. Russell & Prescott Sand Plains: Old deltaic deposits have created sand plains. The sand texture varies from coarse in the north to fine in the south. It reaches a maximum depth of around 9 m. Soils are well-drained with the water issuing from river bluffs into clay valleys. ==Ottawa Valley Clay Plain: The clay plain is interrupted by ridges of rock or sand. The proportion of acid soil is greater than in the Winchester Clay Plain. ==; Winchester Clay Plain: Although clay plains dominate, they are punctuated by other features such as till protrusions, low drumlins, bars and beaches. The soils are generally poorly drained. Lancaster Flats: The till plain has been buried under water-laid deposits of clay and sand. It is flat and poorly drained. North Gower Drumlin Field: Drumlins arise from a clay plain. While the drumlins have good drainage, the clay soils are poorly drained. Glengarry Till Plain: The undulating to rolling surface consists of drumlins with clay flats. The loamy till is often less than 8 m deep, but does reach a depth of 30 m. Its stoniness is noticeable.

### ==Original Forests of Eastern Ontario==

There are few scientific data available on the original forests of eastern North America, and the challenges in reconstructing them are summarized in Botkin (1990). Three sources of information were examined to prepare a description of presettlement forests in the region: (1) literature on preserved pollen in lake sediments, (2) historical references, and (3) descriptions of existing remnants.

More specific to the MF region, palynological sequences have recently been studied by Hall (1993) in three lakes: Long Lake (North Burgess Twp.) and Flower Round Lake (Lavant Twp.), Singleton Lake (Leeds-Lansdowne Rear Twp.). All tell a similar story.

Around 11,000 years ago, the area was sparsely vegetated by herb-shrub tundra. This was followed by a dwarf-shrub tundra with spruce. After 9,500, a coniferous forest dominated by pine emerged. There was a shift to hemlock dominated forests with hardwoods (sugar maple, oak, beech, birch, elm) on the rise 7,500 years ago. A major event occurred in this mixed deciduous forest about 4,800 years ago when hemlock trees apparently died en masse. This die off occurred throughout eastern North America. It has been suggested that the cause was a rapidly spreading disease, like Dutch Elm Disease, which removed elm trees from our landscape in the early 1960's. With the decline in hemlock, hardwoods increased in abundance. ==About 3,500 years ago, hemlock recovered and oak began to decline.==

==It is in the last 150 years that the most dramatic changes have occurred in vegetation cover-- forests were cleared, roads were constructed and weeds invaded. Ragweed, which causes so much human suffering each summer, invaded with the settlers. Its sudden increase in abundance in lake sediment is so dramatic that ragweed pollen is a good marker for determining which portions of sediment cores date from periods after European settlement. One draw back of pollen data is that lakes accumulate pollen from a large geographic area. The record in any lake therefore combines information on forest cover from many site types, but is a good indicator of "regional vegetation" (for anemophilous species). To get information on forest composition at a finer scale, we must turn to other sources.==

**TIE TO [[SHIFTING BASELINE SYNDROME]] the appearance of ragweed only after early European settlers!**


Early newspapers (e.g. Mirickville (Canada West) Chronicle), and settlers' journals or letters provide some impressions of the nature of the forests the settlers found when they arrived in the region. These, and other sources, have been used to reconstruct the history of settlement in the MF region in recent publications such as Lockwood (1991) (Beckwith Twp.), Brown (1984), McGill (1968) (Lanark Co.), Lockwood (1980) (Montague Twp.), MacGillivray and Ross (1979) (Glengarry Co.), Burns et al. (1972) (March Twp.), and McKenzie (1967) (Leeds and Grenville Co.). Because the European settlers were far more interested in levelling the forest to open the land for agriculture than they were in noting its qualities and composition, most historical accounts are fragmentary at best, and negative and subjective at worst. Below is a sample of quotations from settlement times that will provide a picture of the forests as they were seen. 8 Early settlers in Beckwith Township describe their experience of the forest as follows (Lockwood 1991), "There is something in the ponderous stillness of these forests-- something in their wild, torn, mossy darkness, their utter solitude and mournful silence which impresses the traveller with a new aspect each time he sees them ... In Upper Canada the endless hills of pine give way at last, or at most stand thinly intermingled with gigantic beeches, tall hemlocks and ash, with maples, birch and wild sycamore, the underwood of these great leafy hills. Mile after mile, and hour after hour of such a route was passed-- a dark black solitude, with here and there a vista opening up, showing the massive trunks, grey as cathedral ruins, which bore the rich canopy of leaves aloft." (Sycamore is native to more southern parts of Ontario. A modern equivalent for "wild sycamore" was not found.) Another immigrant described other aspects of the forests (Lockwood 1991), "The greater part of the forest, the underwood or bramble, is not as thick as at home but a great deal of it is worse to go through than the worst of Crucatone Wood... [C]onceive Paisley Moors, for instance, all grown over with large trees, some fresh and green, others half rotten and a great many rotten from top to bottom, and almost as many lying in all directions as are standing, with not a living creature to be seen or heard except a bird or two, and the owl screaming in your ears at night." A Lanark County pioneer described a forest "through which the sun never penetrated" (McGill 1968). Some information concerning the appearance of forests in Montague Township were provided by a settler faced with the task of forest clearing (Lockwood 1980), "There is always a great quantity of timber lying on the ground, which has been blown down by the wind, and must be cut up." Additional descriptive material might be obtained in the numerous travel accounts catalogued by Craig (1963).


# ==[[Surveyors' Notebooks]]==

Information on the forests of southern Ontario was recorded by crown surveyors who began surveying in 1783 (Gentilcore 1969) as a prelude to European settlement. As the surveyors laid out the boundaries of counties, townships and lots within, they described the vegetation, hydrology, topography and soils of the land they traversed. There is considerable variability in the quantity and quality of the information recorded. Some surveyors listed up to five tree species when describing forest cover, while others would list only the most common or none. Typically, each time tree species composition changed along the concession boundary walked by the surveyor, he would note the distance in chains and links, and list the species present in order of abundance. No indication of forest structure was provided. Occasionally, "small pine" or "good timber" and evidence of fire would be noted.

### Data Collection
- pg 9: "Information on forests in the region was obtained from surveyors' notebooks and used as follows. The objective was to reconstruct the forest cover for each of the larger physiographic types represented in the region. From a physiographic map (Chapman and Putnam 1984), I selected townships which represented the five major physiographic types (sand plains, clay plains, till and rock (precambrian), limestone plains, till plains). Given the preliminary nature of this investigation (to provide an overview of historical forest cover), data from physiographic regions representing the same physiographic type were combined. For example data for sand plains were obtained from townships on the Edwardsburg Sand Plain and from the Russell and Prescott Sand Plains. The proportion of the type data obtained from each physiographic region was directly related to the size of the region. Using the list of surveyors notebooks by township provided by Gentilcore and Donkin (1973), notebooks covering townships representative of the five physiographic types were identified. Records for clay plains were taken from surveyors' notes for Alfred, Cambridge, Huntley, and Pakenham townships. Sand plain data were obtained from Cambridge and Edwardsburgh townships. Forest cover in the precambrian region was recorded for Pakenham, Beckwith and Darling townships. For limestone plains, records were taken from Bastard, Kitley and Drummond townships. From Lancaster and Osnabruck townships, forest cover for till plains was recorded. At the Survey and Mapping Branch of the Ministry of Natural Resources (Toronto), all the notebooks for a particular township were examined. For each township, notebooks covering concessions that occurred well within the physiographic type of interest were selected for further review. For each of these notebooks, the number of species frequently listed by the surveyor for each entry was determined (sometimes none, usually 3, rarely 5). Notebooks in which none or only one species was listed for each entry were put aside where there were other notebooks with better species lists for nearby areas. Having thus selected notebooks with the greatest level of detail, concessions occurring well within the physiographic type within the township were identified. Lot selection on each concession was based on position as indicated on the physiographic map, prior to the detailed examination of surveyors' notebooks. Data were recorded for 4 to 24 (typically 10-18) lots on each concession sampled. The number of lots sampled on each concession depended upon the length of the concession within the physiographic type and the need to obtain a representative sample of the physiographic type by distributing lots among several concessions. The total number of lots selected in each township for each physiographic type reflected the size of the physiographic type in the township relative to the size of the physiographic type for the MF region."
- "For each physiographic type, data were recorded for a total of 80 lots (76 lots on clay plain and 33 lots on till plain, due to time constraints). For each lot, the tree species present in the first type of forest cover encountered by the surveyor were recorded. The order in which they were listed (relative abundance) was also noted (Appendix A). Data from lots noted by the surveyors as wet, swamp or lowland were used in the analysis of lowland forest. Those not so noted were used in the analysis of upland forest. The numbers of upland and lowland lots sampled are not standardized, but vary according to the terrain within the physiographic types over which the surveyors walked. The numbers of upland and lowland lots (indicated in brackets, respectively) examined in each physiographic type were as follows: till and rock (60,20), sand plain (75,5), clay plain (71,5), limestone plain (68,12), till plain- undrumlinized (23,10). Some species names noted by the surveyors are not used today. Where known, the old names have been changed to current names (e.g. water elm = American elm; rock maple = red maple; Norway pine = red pine) through reference to older botanical manuals (A. Dugal, pers. comm.). For other names, where more than one modern name could be used (e.g. soft maple = silver maple/red maple; water ash = Manitoba maple- less likely/black ash- more likely), the original name is retained. In accounts where both white oak and oak are listed, oak could be either red or bur. References to white oak may include bur oak. In surveyors' notebooks and in this report, maple, beech, hemlock, fir, pine and cedar refer to the following species, respectively: sugar maple, American beech, eastern hemlock, balsam fir, white pine, white cedar." (10)

### Data Analysis and Interpretation
- pg 10: "The data from surveyors' notebooks were analyzed in two ways for physiographic types. First, the frequency of occurrence of individual tree species was examined. The percentage of the upland lots on which each species was recorded (regardless of position in the species list) was determined. Similarly, the frequency of occurrence of each species on lowland lots was calculated. In addition, for uplands, the percentage of the lots on which each species was listed as the first, second or third species in surveyors' lists was determined. There were insufficient data to do a similar analysis for lowlands. The second way the data for uplands were analyzed was to determine the frequency of occurrence of species combinations. For each lot the combinations of first and second species recorded were listed. The percentage of the lots having each combination of first and second species was calculated. These species combinations do not correspond to cover types, but simply represent species that were found growing together. These data therefore do not allow the assignment of cover types to physiographic types. The original data for sand plains were not available for the preliminary combination and wetland species analyses. Their acquisition is recommended as a priority for future work (section 4.0). There are some considerations and limitations concerning the use of data from surveyors' notebooks that should be noted. The level of detail (numbers of species listed for each forest cover) varies among surveyors. The level of detail and the accuracy of species and wetland/lowland identification may be related to the time of year the surveyor was in the field."
- pg 11: "In the winter, soil moisture may not be obvious. In the fall and winter species identification would be more difficult (foliage absence) and conditions would discourage lengthy note-taking. Even the most comprehensive notes on forest cover represent transects through townships, for the establishment of lot corners, not for the purpose of providing comprehensive forest cover data. The forest cover analysis and interpretation for any physiographic type is constrained to areas where adequate data are available."

#### Upland Forest
##### Tree Species Frequency

**Table 1** shows the frequencies of tree species in upland forest (forest not noted as wetland or lowland in surveyors' notes) varied with physiography. Using this table, a map of historical forest cover was prepared (Figure 3). The species richness of these forests ranged from nine (till plain) to 19 species (clay plain). Seven species occurred in all five physiographic types (sugar maple, beech, elm, basswood, hemlock, cedar, ash). Sugar maple was most frequently recorded on limestone plains and till plains. Beech was found most often on till plains, followed by limestone plains. Elm was most common on limestone plains where it occurred on 60% of the lots. ==Basswood was most frequent on clay and till plains. Hemlock was found in close to half the lots examined in all regions except clay plains. Cedar and ash occurred in less than 15% of the lots in all physiographic types. In the lots examined, white pine was not recorded from the limestone plain. Oak and white oak as well as red pine and red spruce were recorded infrequently and only on clay plains. Poplar and soft maple were noted only on sand and clay plains. Till and rock, sand plains and clay plains supported birch and balsam fir.==
![[Table 1.png]]
![[Figure 3.png]]

- **Table 2** shows that ==sugar maple== was the dominant species on limestone plains and a co-primary species on sand plains (with hemlock) and ==clay plains (with white pine).== Hemlock dominated till and rock. On till plains, beech (almost as frequently mentioned as sugar maple, Table 1), was more often listed first.
![[Table 2.png]]

- **Table 3** shows the frequency of species occurring second in surveyors' species lists. Considering the three most frequent species for each physiographic type, ==sugar maple is again an important secondary component of forest cover. On all types except till and rock, elm frequently occurs as secondary species.== Beech is the most common secondary species on sand plains and important on limestone and till plains. ==Spruce is a secondary component on sand and clay plains.== White pine was observed as a major secondary component only on till and rock.
![[Table 3.png]]

- The frequencies of tertiary species are shown in **Table 4.** Basswood was the most frequent tertiary species in four physiographic types. On limestone plains, elm was often the third species listed. ==Hemlock occurred in all types, most commonly on limestone and till plains.Balsam fir was listed as a significant tertiary species on clay plains== while white pine and birch were important only on sand plains. On till and rock, no one species was often listed as a tertiary cover component.
![[Table 4.png]]

### Species combinations
- **Table 5** ==Twenty-four combinations were found on clay plains. A maple-elm combination occurred on 25% of the lots, followed in abundance by red spruce, pine-maple, basswood-maple and pinespruce. No tertiary species were listed with red spruce or pine-maple combinations. Red spruce was recorded only from Alfred Township. With pine-maple combinations, basswood and white oak occurred as tertiary species. With pine-spruce combinations, balsam fir was also recorded.==
![[Table 5.png]]

#### Lowland Forest
- "From 6% to 30% of the lots sampled for each physiographic type were classified as lowlands or wetlands by the surveyors. The frequency of tree species occurring on these lots is shown in Table 6. In three types, cedar was the most frequent species listed while elm occurred on 60% of the lowland clay plain lots. Other lowland species included alder, ash, tamarack, spruce, willow, white oak and water ash. Further detailed analysis by position in the species list is not warranted given the small number of lots sampled" (17)
![[Table 6.png]]

### Forest Remnants
- "As a last source of evidence, we can examine our older tracts of forest, and assume that those old tracts with relatively less human disturbance provide a reasonable example (or at least the best we have) of past forests. Eastern Ontario has been so thoroughly disturbed that there is little such evidence to draw upon. There is only one known site (Shaw Woods, Dugal 1980) that has been considered virgin forest. It occurs north of the MF region and represents upland mixed forest dominated by beech, sugar maple, hemlock and basswood (White 1990). The largest trees in this woods range from 90 to 60 cm in diameter. Moderate to large snags (standing dead) and logs are common. Small openings comprise 10% of the canopy and are the result of the loss of a single tree or a small group of trees. The forest floor is a combination of pits and mounds. As a result of a preliminary inventory of twelve additional candidate old growth areas in the vicinity of the MF region, White (1990) found one area (Collins Lake, 15 km north of Kingston) of upland mixed forest that probably could be considered old growth. It is dominated by hemlock, sugar maple and beech and occurs in sandy soil over limestone. Further evaluation is required for confirmation. Sites within the MF region may yet exist, and work is needed to explore thoroughly for them." (21)
- "There are other tracts of virgin forest in nearby areas of the Untied States from which we can obtain additional information. Stand tables for old growth hardwood-hemlock forest in states bordering on the Great Lakes have been made (Eyre and Zillgitt 1953, in Bourdo 1983) but were unavailable for preparing this report. Bourdo (1956) has, however, made tables for stands in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. He found that sugar maple did not often exceed 75 cm in diameter, although some occasionally approached 1 m. The diameter of most dominants ranged from 45 to 55 cm. Yellow birch was larger than sugar maple on average, with some trees more than 1 m in diameter. The largest hemlocks exceeded 1.25 m, but most were the size of the maples. Elm and basswood were minor components, but did reach sizes comparable to the largest hemlocks. Large basswood frequently was hollow and ringed with root-collar sprouts. Some white pine attained diameters of more than 1.25 m when growing singly among hardwoods. In pine forests, most good sized trees ranged from 50 to 75 cm in diameter. On poorer soil (as would be the case in the Precambrian region of eastern Ontario), trees under 50 cm predominated. Bourdo also notes that the cull percentage (defect factor), as interpreted by foresters, sometimes exceeded 40% and typically averaged 25%. Studies in eastern North America (Muller and Liu 1991, Onega and Eickmeier 1991, Harmon et al. 1986, Bormann and Likens 1979) indicate that coarse woody debris (logs, snags, branches) typically is found at more than 20 Mg/ha in old growth forests. As well, undisturbed forest will have large, heavily decayed logs (MacMillan 1981)." (22)
- **some presettlement disturbances may have been caused by tree diseases/insect epidemics, fire, wind disturbances, and flooding by beaver pond.** Likely also some Indigenous land use practices.

#### Indigenous Land Use
- will need to research more tbh
- primarily Algonquin in area, also maybe some Mohawk (a few claims)
-  "In historic times the Algonquins and St. Lawrence Iroquoians were the main groups who lived in eastern Ontario. The Matouweskarini, an Algonquin band, was settled along the Madawaska River in the early 17th century; further to the east the Onontchataronon were settled along the South Nation River (Fig. 5a). We can say with some confidence that there was little clearance of land for agriculture by the Algonquin Indians, although there is some evidence that in the 17th century Algonquins did create small fields which were planted with corn, beans and squash. In general it appears that the economy was based upon hunting and gathering, with trapping and trading becoming more important as the European demand for furs resulted in the fur trade." (25)

### European Settlement and Land Clearance for Agriculture
-  "The first Europeans explored Ontario in the 1600's, and were followed by fur traders. Small numbers of primarily French and British settlers came during the 1600's and 1700's. During the mid 1700's, French and English armies, fought for control of North America (Parkman 1884). During the American War of Independence in the 1770's, 10,000 United Empire Loyalists fled the United States with the aid of the Iroquoian people. Areas were set aside by the Mohawk people for the use of United Empire Loyalists in 1763. In 1763, crown land surveys were begun to describe lots for settlers. The pattern of settlement of eastern Ontario is shown in (Figure 6) based on dates when survey systems were initiated (Gentilcore and Donkin 1973). The majority of the region was surveyed beginning in 1783. Surveying of the remainder of the region began in 1815 and was completed by 1829. In some ways loggers were loath to see forests cut and simply burned when they could produce timber to feed sawmills. But on the other hand, small farms produced food to support the logging camps. ==Land near the rivers was settled first. By 1800, the Rideau River still formed the northwestern boundary of settled lands (McGill 1968). The Rideau Canal was built between 1826 and 1832 to link Bytown (Ottawa) with Kingston. Settlement then moved northwest." (25) - **not quite right, there was some settlement above**==
![[Figure 6.png]]


The primary objective of the settlers was to remove forest and replace it with fields to produce agricultural products. Trees were merely an obstacle to development. They were often just felled and burned to make way for crops, although in other cases the trees were burned to generate ash as a raw material for making potash (McGill 1968, Lockwood 1980). One Perth area firm handled 450 barrels of potash per year in the 1840's (McCalla 1987). In some cases squatters only occupied the land long enough to turn the trees into potash (McGill 1968). This represented not only a considerable volume of forest lost, but an actual export of soil fertility. By 1861, 17 townships in the MF region had already reached levels of forest cover of less than 30%, with three, including Lavant Township, having less than 10% (Fig. 7a). Forest cover continued to decline over the following twenty years, and by 1880 there were 32 townships with less than 30% cover and eight townships with less than 10% cover (Fig. 7b). These figures do not include 13 townships for which no 1880 data were available. In 1992, only 17 townships had less than 30% forest cover (Fig. 7c). This is an increase in cover since 1880. The majority of these townships had 20-30% cover in 1880. There were many negative consequences of this loss of forest. They included (1) shortages of fuel wood, (2) declines in wheat production owing to the lack of standing timber for shelter, (3) snow drifts blocking roads, (4) severe spring floods and reduced summer stream flow and (5) even reduction in the distribution and amount of rainfall (Kelly 1974). Although Kelly discounts the latter, he does not give his reasons; given the effects of trees increasing evapotranspiration, this effect should not be discounted. Decreased wheat production was more likely due to loss of soil fertility.
- Confederation occurred in 1867. By 1889 maps show a network of railways and canals crossing eastern Ontario and linking it with other centres such as Parry Sound, Toronto and Montreal. A century later the Ottawa-Hull metropolitan area has become the fourth largest in Canada with a population size approaching a million people. The transition from forest, to farm to suburbs has occurred in just a few human generations, or about the life span of a sugar maple tree!

### Logging
- "The history of logging in the Ottawa valley is well-known (McGill 1968, McCalla 1987, Head 1975, 1980) and will be summarized here. Logging companies were already at work in the Ottawa Valley in the late 1700's, and the pace of cutting quickened during the early 1800's when the Napoleonic Wars blocked access to traditional British timber sources in the Baltic area. White pine was most in demand. The attitude towards hardwoods by the pine operators is illustrated by the following quotation in Kennedy (1947, p. 5) from a Bytown (Ottawa) resident, "Surrounding this pine territory and contiguous to the great lumber fields is the large area to which we have alluded, possessing a fertile soil and timbered with hardwood. This timber has not the value of pine, and its destruction is not a national loss." Trees were felled, squared, floated downstream, assembled into large rafts and eventually floated to Montreal for export to Europe. In 1845 the upper Ottawa River watershed was the source of more than 12 million cu ft of squared pine timber; eastern Ontario was the source of several additional million (Rideau District and Lower Ottawa District) (Head 1975). From Ontario as a whole, oak, elm and tamarack were also cut as square timber, but the proportion produced in the MF region is not known (Head 1975). In the mid 1800's, there may have been up to 7000 raftsmen employed along the Ottawa River (McCalla 1987). Waves of loggers then removed the smaller timber for sawmilling. In 1871, 490,000 standard pine logs were harvested from the MF region (Head 1975). No additional data have been published that would allow early trends in the volume of forest products to be assessed. Logging decreased the reproductive potential of red and white pine in several ways. Once the vast supplies of historical stands were largely eliminated by logging, the probability that widely spaced good seed years would coincide with desirable post-disturbance seedbeds was dramatically reduced. Those seedlings that did develop had to be free from disturbance for about 25 years before they themselves contributed substantially to the seed supply. The pine portion of the forest cover was thus rapidly reduced and not restored. Fire incidence increased as a result of logging (see 3.5.1, 3.5.2) which also reduced reproduction. In a little over a century the great forests were largely gone. Although we may romanticize the history of life in the lumber camps, the historian Grant Head, who has studied forest exploitation in 19th century Ontario, was led by his studies to observe "... the clearing that resulted from 19th century sawlogging must have shocked even 19th century minds, and can today be described only as a desecration"."
