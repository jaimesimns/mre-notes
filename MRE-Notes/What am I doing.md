geolocated soundscapes and walking

Ottawa as the capital of a settler state

walking as embodied knowledge but also as a political manouever
- walking as in engaging with government-supported movement throughout the city (ie: through the myriad of walking places, Ottawa as 'a walking-friendly place' - find quote)
- walking with the soundscape as a political act of rejecting that - using the 'correct' walking paths and walking methods as a way to engage with the soundscape and explore the rejected history of Ottawa
	- draws on Ottawa's hypocrisy about what they celebrate/mention about the creation of the city
			- can't admit or acknowledge faults if they're hidden (such as Ottawa's role in steamboat imperialism and colonialism)
			- also the constructed nature of wilderness/deliberate paths the city has created (should mention about the Indigenous walks and how I'm sure there was a path here/that we should acknowledge land ownership the whole way through)
	- examines the way that the lumber trade, steamboats, etc. are commemorated - through street names of famous white men and the retention of certain records in LAC, but that it's mostly ignored otherwise/not widely discussed
			- which means that the environmental history (of resource extraction, both for lumber and mining and for steamboat fuel) and the social history beyond 'the shriner's wars' (ie: typhoid and other disease epidemics, shantytowns, the role of women during this time, Indigenous people; settlement-based history in general beyond the immediate of 'white men came to empty land', and tourism) is ignored. My MRE cannot fit all of that, and nor should it - I could not do all of them justice in 30-60 pages. It is hard enough to do even one of those justice, and so my MRE is a very light survey, done as a case study to elucidate the usefulness of geolocated soundscapes. This is not a thesis paper and nor is it expected to be - it has been explained to me that I "need enough history to support [my] decisions" and that "we aren't expected to produce original historical research" [1]. To that end, I will include further reading recommendations in the footnote, but this MRE will focus more on the process of my MRE, as is expected of public history MREs (especially when they intersect with digital humanities).

Ottawa is a city that isn't really a city - it's a thinly veiled colonial nightmare, where almost everyone is either a public servant or wants to be a public servant. There are jobs that support the people who work as public servants, because public servants need places to spend money and relax, but Ottawa is basically a government town. The NCC, which "is a crown corporation of the Government of Canada [whose] goal is to ensure that Canada's Capital Region is a source of national pride and significance"[2]. Through that, the NCC basically runs all of Ottawa's heritage. In their pursuit for "national pride and significance," they focus only on its heritage as the nation's capital, at the expense of the rest of its history. As many folks have said in one way or another, 'you can't fix what you don't acknowledge' [4]. Ignoring the city's heritage, and the heritage of the Ottawa River region in general, does a disservice to everyone.

This MRE draws heavily on ideas about steamboat imperialism as a framework for exploring the different aspects of colonialism that this steamboat history intersects with.

			" Canada's Capital Region represents the heart of our great nation. It is the centre of our democracy, and a symbol of the country's collective history, heritage, culture and natural features. Building on more than a century of experience, the NCC provides unique value in the Capital Region by fulfilling three specific roles: long-term planner of federal lands; principal steward of nationally significant public places; creative partner committed to excellence in development and conservation" [3].
