It's been a while since I've been able to work on my MRE (finals time is a very busy time), but I attended a really interested artist talk by Jez riley French (r lowercase on purpose) hosted by RIVERSSOUNDS. He's a UK "field recording artist," who works both with sonifications and found sound that he captures and turns into sound art. During his residency at RIVERSSOUNDS, he worked with the Humber River using geophones, hydrophones, etc.
