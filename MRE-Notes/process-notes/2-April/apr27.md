# Content Thoughts from Earlier
[[process-notes]]

I am thinking of using auditory icons in the sonification of the datasets (like https://egyptbuildingcollapses.org/) to use the semi-representative sound to evoke emotion (ie: bird noises disappearing over time to represent quantities of trees cut); my goal is to take the data sonification and move it from noise to {semi-pleasant} sound to talk about the affective quality/create an affective quality (also with art of the landscape similar to soundmarks; I really liked the interplay there). Also thinking of site-specific recordings (depending on car access, etc.) to work into the soundscape too to flesh it out. =={*current note: thinking of scaling it to a section of the SJAM pathway along the Ottawa River (a) bc colonial connection, (b) feasibility bc Dr. Graham suggested that an unmoored soundwalk may not be possible. From Portage Bridge to Champlain Bridge, perhaps? It's about an hours walk, so maybe that's too long? Not sure, need to think more. But, it would work well for the soundscape timing.*}==

My general plans for using the auditory icons, either with shipwreck data as a temporal base or a sonification of the closest shipwreck(s)? Still working on that, depending on if this will lead to one track or three tracks.
1.    Chats Rapids (where the UOICo fonds records refer to, and a power station is now – paint landscape top-view pre and post dam/power station
a.    Use the data sonification of the freight/passenger traffic with inaudible talking as the auditory icon? 
i.    Ambient noise of recordings from Fitzray Prov Park/Morris Island (probably from on the water/in the water since the data is water-focused)
ii.    Also with a sonification of an image of the shipwreck(s) in that area? Or of the closest one? Or as the base of the track, if one track. Alex Fraser, 1942 almost at same spot, Pontiac, 1908, G. H. Perley, 1895,   Mink, 1945, Weldon, after 1919
iii.    Or as a temporal basing for the track based on shipwrecks sunk that year (1871-1872): Otter, 1870,     Ann Sisson, 1871,  Maggie Bell, 1874,  Mary Ann, 1874,  Forest Queen, 1874
(sorry, did not mean to bold those parts)
2.    Chalk River Laboratories (nuclear archive data)
a.    Use data sonification of whatever data I end up finding along with recorded noises
i.    Find out more about what went on in that region for additional noise
ii.    Sonification of shipwrecks in that area: Reliance, 1896 - almost at same spot, John Egan, 1882, or
iii.    Time-focused; similar to creation of CRL in 1944: Mink, 1945, Beloeil, 1945, Alex Fraser, 1942
3.    Temiskaming area/very northern-most point of the Ottawa River; something about logging and shift from hardwoods to softwoods; several records at LAC including summary of quantities passing through the Works (1894-1979); ICO log records from 1870-1894 from LAC; 1895-1903; 1904 – 1920; 1921 - 1935; timber records 1870-1992; Footage passing the works 1894-1979; ICO footage records 1870 
i.    Bird sounds or saw and pulp mills as appropriate for auditory icon
1.    Forest composition pre- and post-industrialization! http://www.forestresearch.ca/Projects/Sustain/PICSiteRegionPublishedReportPintoetalCJFR2008July.pdf
ii.    Sonification of shipwrecks in area: Aileen, 1914; Temiskaming, 1926; Meteor, 1926; Lady Minto, 1968, Wenona, Anne Marie, Wanakewan, Comet (1902)

If I go with the steamship images (if it’s split into three tracks), then I would use the pitch map of the photosounder of an image (not the direct sound) and not the direct photosounder sound, because in my tests with the Ann Sisson there was a lot of very similar noise and it’s very unpleasant to listen to, and (in my opinion) doesn’t really serve to create affect.
