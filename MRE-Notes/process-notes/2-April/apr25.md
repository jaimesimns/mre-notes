[[process-notes]]
This is a quick note to state my intentions: I want to use my citations as 'care,' following Sara N. Ahmed. I want to push the mainstream citations from old white men and go father into the field, to diversify my citations but also to cite who I want and who inspires me, as opposed to who people think I should cite.

I want this to be an experiment in sound, but also an experiment in citations.

queer ecology, black feminist ecology, queer sound theory, trans sound theory, feminist sound theory(?).

Queer, trans, Black diapora theory are not only for queer, trans, and Black diaspora topics. They can and should apply to the environment, ecology, sound, etc.

  Sara N. Ahmed: "The reproduction of a discipline can be the reproduction of these techniques of selection, ways of making certain bodies and thematics core to the discipline, and others not even part."
