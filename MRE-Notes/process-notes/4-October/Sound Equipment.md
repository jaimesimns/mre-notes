==DECISION==
Sound equipment and travel are not covered by the Underhill fund, so I will use my phone. The video sound is better than the voice memo sound, so I will record videos and then use only the sound file from the video. I may include the video for some of the passages but that will depend on how good they are/if the videos are useful for expressing my point or not.

The best type of microphones to get traditionally for this practice are [small-diaphragm condenser mics](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&xs=1&url=https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/buy/Small-Diaphragm-Condensers/ci/14703/N/4291086010&referrer=theverge.com&sref=https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/28/12609724/record-your-own-soundscapes&xcust=___vg__p_12373765__t_w__r_google.com__d_D) that have a [cardioid polar pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone#Microphone_polar_patterns). Positioning two microphones in a stereo array such as the [XY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone_practice#X-Y_technique:_intensity_stereophony) or [ORTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORTF_stereo_technique) technique will get you a wide, full sound in stereo and make the listener feel like they are out in the woods with you. You can also get a binaural setup, with two mics set up similarly to human ears.

MAKE SURE YOU GET SOME ISOLATING HEADPHONES

Of course, you don’t need to use two microphones. Using a single [shotgun microphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone#Shotgun_and_parabolic_microphones) is a great way to record very specific parts of a soundscape, like a bird up in a tree, rain drops onto leaves, or animal footsteps. Try buying or [making your own parabola](https://www.videomaker.com/article/f20/17144-how-to-build-a-parabolic-mic-dish) if you're trying to catch something super specific from farther away.
