## Writing Advice
- main PH thesis: making the argument that a geolocated soundscape is an affective piece of public history
- main historical thesis: attending to the affective and emotional aspect of sound and place is an effective pedagogical experience for learning environmental history
	- history-wise: need to demonstrate that you know the kind of history that you are intersecting with ==draw on Joanna's broader historical comments, etc. bc she will probably be one of the readers==
	- include whatever archive/etc that you are sonifying/interacting with + ==context for why you want to sonify that stuff, sonify it, and then show why it matters/what you can take away from doing these things==
- blow-by-blow of MRE doesn't need to be in paper; can go in a GitHub repo instead
- the digital product doesn't need to match the paper timeline - it's the paper that you submit and its timeline that matters, but it should have enough of the product to help reviewers get a sense of how it is/will be done
	- can see what they're going for and how they're going to do it, how it intersects with theory and method, historiography that you've lifted, etc. 
- length of paper (with a digital product) is 20-40 pages but content matters more
	- contextualising soundscape with geolocation in the context of public history will take several pages
	- discussing the logic of your piece and how it works and what it's meant to evoke will take several as well
