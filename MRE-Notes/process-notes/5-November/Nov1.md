[[process-notes]]

Today I started looking into the [[Surveyors' Notebooks]] for logging and timber-trade data.

List of potential data sources is here: [[tree logging readings]]

I have done [[Keddy, Cathy]] [[Keddy, 1993.pdf]] and compiled her charts, which will be useful. 

These charts are:
[[Table 1.png]] [[Table 2.png]] [[Table 3.png]] [[Table 4.png]] [[Table 5.png]] [[Table 6.png]] and [[Figure 3.png]] [[Figure 4.png]] [[Figure 6.png]]

Her data, compiled into two tables, are in [[Pre-settler tree data (compiled)]]. They are ready for sonification!

I read Dupuis, S., D. Arseneault, and L. Sirois., but it was for the wrong region (Eastern Quebec, not Western Quebec which I would need); I have since found three more papers on Western Quebec (two historic forests and one modern): ######. I still need to find a paper for modern north-eastern Ontario forest composition.

==Need to make sure that I am never expressing that the forests were 'pristine' or static, bc Indigenous land use and also natural fires, disease, etc.==

I have finished reading [[Danneyrolless-2016]] and have added its charts to the [[Pre-settler tree data (compiled)]] page.

Later I will work on these articles/sources.
