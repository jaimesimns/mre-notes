[[process-notes]]

I went to LAC on Nov. 2, and spent six hours in the archive looking through material. I got through everything in my [[LAC User Card and Materials]] list, and gathered some solid data.

From [[Ledger, MG28 III 47, Union Forwarding Company Fonds, Volume 1]], I have about 400 pages of daily-ish passenger/freight lists, including the amount they paid. This could either be used by sonifying a busy day, or I could count the number of people per day for a year or something like that. I'm leaning towards the second, and towards daily totals for passengers (and maybe not their freight) since I want to focus on how steamboats moved people to settle the area. The records are from Ottawa to the Chats Rapids and back, on the steamers Emerald and ---------(check name) from 1841-1842.
