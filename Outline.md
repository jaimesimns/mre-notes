1. Introduction + why (Ottawa ignoring its origins)
2. Why it's important to acknowledge the origins
3. steamboat imperialism (how steamboats were used in rec and sc, plus international ties)
4. how it ties into resource extractive colonialism and settler colonialism (definition, roughly how it was done in Ontario) + general colonialism def?
5. map out the uses of steamboats; also cite Mackey's "Steamboat Connections" re name, because they served as more than just geographic connectors
6. main connections (steamboats used for settler colonialism and resource extraction colonialism; capitalism in both)
	- forwarding 
			- (mail, letters, parcels, etc. - to create social networks and send formal documents (land claims, funding letters, business deals, personal correspondance) in support of settler colonialism
			- early steamers would tow forwarding boats (and people were very excited to have faster and more regular correspondance)
	- timber trade
			- carried work men (lumber jacks, sawmill crews and operators, etc.) up the river to the camps (Tatley and the archive ledger)
			- towed lumber (see Alex Fraser and the Pembroke, both in bookmarks/GradSchool)
			- carried supplies and equipment
			- used to push to remote places
			- alligator tugs helped with the logging itself; other tugs helped to tow, or served as barges carrying lumber (ie: Minnie), etc. 
			- Lumber trade: towed logs and delivered "provisions to the camps in scows"
	- mining
			- men, sometimes ore, equipment
			- Prospectors: took the men and "their gear out to the bush during mining booms, and sometimes brought treasure back on their decks" (Tatley)
			- mostly in regards to railways, but steamers "did play a modest role in the Cobalt boom, bringing prospectors and supplies, notably tools, machinery, and hydro poles from South Témiscaming and farm produce from Ville Marie, and taking out the occassional cargo of ore." (Tatley, 1996, pg 105)
	- settlement and tourism
			- carrying settlers and immigrants
			- ie: in 1884, "La Société de la Colonisation de Lac Temiskaming" was estabished in Ottawa on Dec. 12; - the first six settlers under that colonisation scheme were brought by steamer (the *Mattawan*). (tatley)
			- helped "them reach their lands with their goods and chattels, and by taking hay and produce to the markets"; also "added a little colour and relaxation to the hard, rough life of [early settlers] by running excursion cruises" (Tatley).
	- religion
			- 	carried church officials (both priests and nuns) up the river (see ledger and pg 73 of Tatley)
			- subject to a focus by the Oblates about bringing Christianity (Tatley)
	- disease
			- carried typhoid victims?/other diseased folks? to Grosse Ile, for sure, but maybe less on the Ottawa?
	- railway
			- Railwaymen: assisted by "bringing timber, rails, and supplies - and were often rewarded by being put out of business" (Tatley)
	- paper mills, pulp mills
			- Paper mills: towed "in millions of pulpwood logs"

7. reiterate that it's forgotten, why it's important for this history to be known, and how I intend to bring it back into public memory
8. sound and memory; theory behind sound art + [[History as performance]] to justify
[maybe put the project description section here?]
9. sound theory (soundwalking + walking and embodied knowledge, sonification, sound icons, etc.) (definitions and why); its history (sound art in art, sound art in ecology, sound art in history) + real life examples of its use; where you can go with it; related disciplines - sound art as a way to diversify who you're reading/citing/drawing upon when doing traditional history; sound as rethinking: the usefulness of soundscapes, sonification, soundwalks, (and other things! point to people to look into; ie: audio walks - cite Danielle, podcasts - cite somebody else, sound in video games - Regan, autoethnographic social activism - cite Meranda, walking tours - cite Ona;  cite as many people in the cohort as possible)
10. My project
	1. describe it
			1. the sound aspect
					1. soundscape
					2. sonifications + archival material
					3. where the archival material came from + issues getting it and finding 'good' data
					4. the story I want the sonifications to tell
					5. why sound icons + remixed song parts
					6. soundwalk bc embodied; draw on prev part
			2. the twine part?
	2. explain the process + purpose
	3. what I think it shows about the use of sound in public history, especially re the memory of steamboats and their connections + a (hopefully) increased understanding of settler colonialism and its impact
11. discussion connecting project to earlier talking re colonialism; bring it to the modern day with current issues relating to the original ones + ==the harms/impacts== of them
					1. ** need to make sure that there is a POINT to what I am writing/doing - what specifically do I want to show? the harms/eventualities of those segments; need to make sure that I accomplish that in the project
12. conclusion









---

should note how the role of steamboats changed over time based on phase of expansion along the Ottawa; the upper reaches were reached last, and so had a delayed phase and therefore different uses than the lower Ottawa did during that time



As can be seen in that mapping, steamboats on the Ottawa River serve as a vehicle for connecting all of those histories. This MRE, by nature of not being a PhD dissertation, cannot and will not focus on every aspect, nor on every place along the Ottawa. Instead, this MRE serves as a broad stroke picture, with the primary aim of demonstrating how sound can be used to explore history.

Future research would ideally take the form of a kin-study (after Todd, 2019) relating to Traci Brynne Voyles' "The Settler Sea: California's Salton Sea and the Consequences of Colonialism" by tracing various periods in the Ottawa River's history to examine how "how settler colonialism restructures physical environments in ways that further Indigenous dispossession, racial capitalism, and degradation of the natural world."
